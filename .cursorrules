# Cursor Rules for CBI-V14
# These rules help AI assistants understand what's CURRENT vs LEGACY

## CRITICAL: Read First
1. ALWAYS read `GPT5_READ_FIRST.md` before starting work
2. Use `docs/plans/TRAINING_MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` as source of truth
3. IGNORE everything in `archive/` and `legacy/` directories

## Current Architecture
- Training: Local M4 Mac → Vertex AI deployment
- NOT: BQML training, AutoML, cloud-first
- Source of Truth: `docs/plans/TRAINING_MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`

## Legacy Work (DO NOT USE)
- Everything in `archive/` directory
- Everything in `legacy/` directory
- BQML training plans (we use Vertex AI now)
- AutoML references (we use custom neural models)

## Current Files (USE THESE)
- `scripts/data_quality_checks.py`
- `scripts/export_training_data.py`
- `src/training/baselines/*.py`
- `vertex-ai/deployment/*.py`

## Before Referencing Any File
- Check if it's in `archive/` → IGNORE
- Check if it's in `legacy/` → IGNORE
- Check if it mentions BQML → IGNORE
- Check if it mentions AutoML → IGNORE
