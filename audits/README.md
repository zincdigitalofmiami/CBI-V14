# Audits

All project audits organized by status.

## Structure

- **`active/`** - Currently running audits (modified in last 30 days)
- **`old/`** - Completed audits (by quarter)
- **`new/`** - Recently created, needs manual categorization

## Usage

1. New audits → Create in `new/`
2. Active work → Move to `active/`
3. Completed → Move to `old/YYYY-QX/`

## Examples

- `active/MODEL_PERFORMANCE_AUDIT_NOV2025.md`
- `old/NULL_AUDIT_RESULTS.md`
- `old/COMPREHENSIVE_DATA_AUDIT_Q3.md`
