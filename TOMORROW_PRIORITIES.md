# TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES - CBI-V14

## üö® CRITICAL: Fix Mixed Table Issue

**Problem:** `commodity_prices` table still contains **4,017 mixed rows** across 8 symbols

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Data successfully extracted to factor-specific tables
- ‚ùå Original mixed table still exists with duplicate data

**Solutions (Choose One):**

### Option A: Delete Mixed Table (Recommended)
```sql
-- All data is now in factor-specific tables, safe to delete
DROP TABLE `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.commodity_prices`;
```

### Option B: Archive Mixed Table
```sql
-- Rename for historical reference
CREATE TABLE `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.commodity_prices_archive` AS 
SELECT * FROM `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.commodity_prices`;

DROP TABLE `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.commodity_prices`;
```

### Option C: Convert to Summary Table
```sql
-- Keep as summary/reference table
CREATE VIEW `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.commodity_summary` AS
SELECT 
  symbol,
  COUNT(*) as total_rows,
  MIN(time) as earliest_date,
  MAX(time) as latest_date,
  AVG(close) as avg_price
FROM `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.commodity_prices`
GROUP BY symbol;
```
