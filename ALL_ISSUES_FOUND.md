## Critical Bugs (Must Fix - Production Blocking)

### 1. ✅ SQL Bug: Rolled Forecast Column Reference
**File:** `scripts/1m_feature_assembler.py` line 62  
**Issue:** Query tried to get `rolled_forecast_7d_json` from `signal_value` column instead of `rolled_forecast_7d_json` column  
**Original Code:**
```sql
MAX(CASE WHEN signal_name = 'rolled_forecast_7d' THEN signal_value END) AS rolled_forecast_7d_json
```
**Fixed To:**
```sql
MAX(CASE WHEN signal_name = 'rolled_forecast_7d' THEN rolled_forecast_7d_json END) AS rolled_forecast_7d_json
```
**Impact:** Would return NULL for rolled forecast, breaking gate blend

---

### 2. ✅ Pandas Deprecation: fillna(method=...)
**File:** `scripts/train_distilled_quantile_1m.py` line 72  
**Issue:** `fillna(method='ffill')` deprecated in pandas 2.0+  
**Original Code:**
```python
y = df[target_cols].fillna(method='ffill').values
```
**Fixed To:**
```python
y_df = df[target_cols].ffill().bfill().fillna(0)
y = y_df.values
```
**Impact:** Code would fail in pandas 2.0+

---

### 3. ✅ Schema Hash Inconsistency
**File:** `scripts/1m_schema_validator.py` line 41  
**Issue:** Hash calculation excluded `_` keys, but schema export might include them  
**Original Code:**
```python
feature_names = sorted([k for k in features_dict.keys() if not k.startswith('target_')])
```
**Fixed To:**
```python
feature_names = sorted([k for k in features_dict.keys() 
                       if not k.startswith('target_') and not k.startswith('_')])
```
**Impact:** Schema validation would fail even with correct features

---

### 4. ✅ NaN Handling Missing
**File:** `scripts/1m_feature_assembler.py` lines 136-142  
**Issue:** Feature conversion handled `None` but not `NaN` values  
**Original Code:**
```python
elif isinstance(value, (int, float)):
    complete_features[key] = float(value)
```
**Fixed To:**
```python
elif isinstance(value, (int, float)):
    # Handle NaN values
    if isinstance(value, float) and math.isnan(value):
        complete_features[key] = 0.0
    else:
        complete_features[key] = float(value)
```
**Impact:** NaN values would pass through to model, causing prediction errors

---

### 5. ✅ Missing Math Import
**File:** `scripts/1m_feature_assembler.py`  
**Issue:** Used `math.isnan()` but didn't import `math`  
**Fixed:** Added `import math` at top of file

---

## Logic Errors (Could Cause Runtime Failures)

### 6. ✅ Prediction Output Shape Handling Incomplete
**File:** `scripts/1m_predictor_job.py` lines 118-136  
**Issue:** Only handled `[30,3]` and `[1,30,3]`, not flattened `[90]` format  
**Fixed:** Added handling for flattened format:
```python
elif preds.shape == (90,) or preds.shape == (1, 90):
    # Flattened format: reshape to [30, 3]
    if preds.shape == (1, 90):
        preds = preds[0]
    preds = preds.reshape(30, 3)
```
**Impact:** Would fail if Vertex AI returned flattened array

---

### 7. ✅ Feature Count Logic Inconsistency
**File:** `scripts/1m_schema_validator.py` line 32  
**Issue:** Feature count excluded `_` keys, but not in all places  
**Fixed:** Consistent exclusion of `_` keys everywhere:
```python
actual_count = len([k for k in features_dict.keys() 
                   if not k.startswith('target_') and not k.startswith('_')])
```

---

### 8. ✅ Metadata Keys in Feature Type Conversion
**File:** `scripts/1m_feature_assembler.py` lines 134-148  
**Issue:** Type conversion loop processed metadata keys (like `_rolled_forecast_7d`)  
**Fixed:** Skip metadata keys during conversion:
```python
for key, value in complete_features.items():
    if key.startswith('_'):
        continue  # Skip metadata keys like _rolled_forecast_7d
```

---

## API & Integration Issues

### 9. ✅ API Route Parameterization Error
**File:** `dashboard-nextjs/src/app/api/explain/route.ts` line 38  
**Issue:** BigQuery client doesn't support `params` in query options the way it was used  
**Fixed:** Use string replacement:
```typescript
const queryWithParams = query.replace('@future_day', String(future_day))
```

---

### 10. ✅ BigQuery DELETE Query Parameterization
**Files:** 
- `scripts/1m_predictor_job.py` line 197
- `scripts/1w_signal_computer.py` line 153
- `scripts/calculate_shap_drivers.py` line 188
**Issue:** Used parameterized queries for DELETE, but simpler string interpolation works better  
**Fixed:** Use direct string interpolation:
```python
delete_query = f"""
DELETE FROM `{table_id}`
WHERE as_of_timestamp = TIMESTAMP('{as_of_timestamp}')
"""
```

---

### 11. ✅ Timestamp Format Consistency
**Files:** All scripts writing timestamps  
**Issue:** Using `isoformat()` without timezone clarity  
**Fixed:** Added 'Z' suffix for UTC:
```python
as_of_timestamp = datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + 'Z'  # Add Z for UTC clarity
```

---

## Infrastructure & Configuration Issues

### 12. ✅ BigQuery Location Not Specified
**File:** `scripts/create_all_tables.py` line 26  
**Issue:** BigQuery query didn't specify location  
**Fixed:** Added explicit location:
```python
job = client.query(sql, location='us-central1')  # Explicit location
```

---

### 13. ✅ Traffic Split Validation Logic
**File:** `scripts/health_check.py` lines 51-63  
**Issue:** Only checked for `deployed_model_id` in traffic split, but first deployment uses '0'  
**Fixed:** Handle both formats:
```python
if deployed_model_id in traffic_split:
    traffic_percent = traffic_split[deployed_model_id]
elif '0' in traffic_split:
    traffic_percent = traffic_split['0']
```

---

### 14. ✅ Endpoint ID Reference Bug
**File:** `scripts/train_distilled_quantile_1m.py` line 240  
**Issue:** Used undefined `endpoint_id` variable  
**Fixed:** Use `endpoint.resource_name`:
```python
endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint(endpoint.resource_name)
```

---

## Code Quality Issues (Non-Blocking)

### 15. ✅ Linter Error: Blank Line at EOF
**File:** `dashboard-nextjs/src/app/api/v4/forward-curve/route.ts`  
**Issue:** Extra blank line at end of file  
**Fixed:** Removed blank line

---

## Known Risks (Not Bugs - Requires Testing)

### ⚠️ Custom Class Deployment
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**File:** `scripts/train_distilled_quantile_1m.py`  
**Issue:** Custom `MultiOutputQuantile` class may not load in sklearn container  
**Status:** Documented as requiring testing  
**Mitigation:** Enhanced error handling, shape validation
