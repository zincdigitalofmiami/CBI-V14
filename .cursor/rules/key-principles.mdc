Key Principles:

Institutional-grade quantitative rigor is the top priority. All data sources, models and metrics should match or exceed Goldman/JPM standards.
Laser focus on the 5 key variance drivers identified: weather (35-45%), supply/demand (30-40%), palm oil (15-25%), macroeconomic factors (15-20%), and biofuel policy.
Real, validated data only. No mocks, hardcoding or placeholder values ever.
BigQuery is the single source of truth. All data flows through BigQuery before the dashboard.
Precision and accuracy trump speed. Be thorough and get the analysis right.
