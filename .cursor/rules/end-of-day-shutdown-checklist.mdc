End-of-Day Shutdown Checklist:
Extreme Safety and Security Scans:

Data Integrity and Anomaly Detection:

Run deep statistical analysis on all new data loaded to BigQuery to identify any anomalies, outliers, or unexpected patterns.
Verify data lineage and provenance for all sources, checking for any breaks in the audit trail.
Compare data snapshots to previous versions to detect any unauthorized modifications or deletions.
Scan for any sensitive or regulated data (PII, PHI, PCI) that may have been inadvertently ingested and quarantine as needed.


Code and Dependency Vulnerability Scans:

Run comprehensive static code analysis to identify any security vulnerabilities, insecure dependencies, or policy violations.
Generate software composition analysis (SCA) reports to inventory all open-source libraries and flag any with known CVEs.
Dynamically test all API endpoints and data flows for SQL injection, XSS, and other OWASP Top 10 risks.
Fuzz test critical input fields with unexpected or malformed data to verify graceful error handling.


Infrastructure and Network Security:

Conduct port scans and vulnerability assessments against all cloud resources to identify any open ports or misconfigurations.
Verify that all network traffic is properly encrypted and that SSL/TLS certificates are valid and up-to-date.
Review all firewall rules and security group configurations to ensure they adhere to least-privilege access.
Monitor VPC flow logs for any suspicious traffic patterns or unauthorized connection attempts.


Access and Authorization Auditing:

Review all user and service account permissions, ensuring that roles align with job functions and that unused accounts are disabled.
Audit all privileged actions (e.g. admin console logins, key rotations) to verify legitimate use.
Scan for any "shadow IT" resources or accounts that may have been provisioned outside of standard governance processes.
Verify that multi-factor authentication is enforced for all human user accounts.


Malware and Intrusion Detection:

Scan all new or modified files for viruses, trojans, and other malware signatures.
Monitor system and application logs for signs of suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.
Verify integrity of critical system files and configurations against known-good baselines.
Conduct penetration tests against external-facing applications and APIs to proactively identify exploitable vulnerabilities.



Forensic Investigation and Incident Response:
In the event that any scans or checks identify potential security incidents, the assistant should immediately trigger the incident response plan, which should include:

Containment: Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread or damage.
Evidence Preservation: Capture forensic images of impacted systems for later analysis.
Notification: Alert security team and stakeholders according to predefined communication matrix.
Investigation: Conduct deep forensic analysis to determine root cause, scope of impact, and attacker tactics.
Recovery: Restore systems to last known-good state and implement mitigations to prevent recurrence.
Lessons Learned: Conduct post-mortem review to identify process improvements and update runbooks.
Data Backup and Versioning:

Ensure all new or modified data has been properly loaded into BigQuery and that data pipelines have completed successfully.
Check that data is correctly partitioned and clustered for optimal query performance.
Verify that data versions are properly tagged and metadata is logged for traceability.


Code Repository Updates:

Commit all code changes to feature branches and open Pull Requests for review as applicable.
Ensure branch names and commit messages follow agreed conventions and accurately describe the changes.
Verify that unit tests pass and code coverage remains above the defined threshold.
Check that documentation (READMEs, code comments, etc.) has been updated to match code changes.


Environment Cleanup and Resource Management:

Shutdown or pause any non-production cloud resources to minimize costs (e.g. dev/test instances).
Delete any temporary files, caches, or intermediate data products that are no longer needed.
Check for any sensitive data (API keys, credentials, PII) that may have been inadvertently logged or cached and scrub as needed.
Review cloud billing dashboard for any unexpected spikes or anomalies in usage costs.


Security and Access Control:

Ensure any new cloud resources are properly tagged and included in the appropriate security groups.
Rotate any access keys or session tokens that are near expiration or no longer needed.
Verify that user access roles and permissions are still appropriate and adhere to least-privilege principles.


Task Management and Handoff:

Update task trackers or project boards with the latest status, blockers, and next steps.
Draft handoff notes for any in-progress work, including key decisions, open questions, and suggested next actions.
Tag or assign any new issues or bugs discovered during the day's work.


Stakeholder Communication:

Summarize key accomplishments, insights or challenges from the day's work in a concise update for stakeholders.
Highlight any decisions or inputs needed and call out upcoming milestones or deadlines.
Proactively address any potential risks or concerns and propose mitigations.
