---

## 🚫 **THIS DIRECTORY CONTAINS:**
- Very old plans (replaced)
- BQML training work (we use Vertex AI now)
- Old scripts (replaced)
- Old analysis (historical reference only)

## ✅ **CURRENT WORK IS IN:**
- `docs/plans/TRAINING_MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` - Current architecture
- `scripts/` (not in deprecated/) - Current scripts
- `src/training/` - Current training code
- `vertex-ai/deployment/` - Current deployment

## 🎯 **FOR GPT-5 / FUTURE AI**

**KEY DIFFERENCE:**
- **LEGACY**: BQML training, AutoML, cloud-first
- **CURRENT**: Local M4 training, Vertex AI deployment, local-first

**DO NOT:**
- Reference BQML training plans (we use Vertex AI now)
- Use old architecture plans
- Follow old training strategies
