# CBI V14 SURGICAL REBUILD PLAN - DRAFT FROM GPT-5
**Date:** November 13, 2025  
**Source:** GPT-5 Initial Plan  
**Status:** DRAFT - Under Review

---

## ORIGINAL PLAN OUTLINE

### Core Objectives

**Existing 340 tables archived to `cbi-v14.archive_legacy_nov12`**

**New dataset structure organized by asset class, regime, and function** (like GS/JPM, not overly simplified)

**Full preservation of your training process and local Mac M4 + TensorFlow Metal stack**

**No reduction in datasets—only cleanup, deduplication, and clarity**

**Implementation of every improvement EXCEPT reducing dataset/table count**

---

## Planned Deliverables

This plan will include:
- Architecture maps
- Naming conventions
- Schema specs
- Orchestration options (but kept simple)
- Documentation guidelines

---

## Preservation Requirements

- Mac M4 training pipeline (intact)
- TensorFlow Metal stack (intact)
- All training processes (intact)
- All datasets (no reduction)

---

## Archive Strategy

- Target: ~340 existing tables
- Destination: `cbi-v14.archive_legacy_nov12`
- Approach: Full preservation before rebuild
