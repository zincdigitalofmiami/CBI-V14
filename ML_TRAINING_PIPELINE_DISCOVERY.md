# ML Training Pipeline Discovery Report

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Scope Confirmed by Owner:** FALSE (awaiting confirmation)  
**Owner Approval to Rewire:** FALSE  
**Report Type:** Discovery & Gap Analysis (No Code Changes)

---

## Executive Summary (3 Lines)

**Main Finding:** NO TRAINING PIPELINES FOUND - only BigQuery ARIMA models created manually via console (no training code). Data collection is operational but lacks feature engineering, labeling, training orchestration, model registry, and validation frameworks required for ensemble ML.

**Immediate Blocker:** Raw data flowing but no transformation → features → labels → training cycle exists.

**Critical Gap:** "Neural/learning pipelines" mentioned in vision but ZERO implementation found in codebase.

---

## 1. TRAINING PIPELINE VERDICT: MISSING

### Evidence Checked:
```bash
# Search for training code
find . -name "*.py" | xargs grep -l "train\|fit\|LightGBM\|XGBoost\|LSTM"
# Result: NO TRAINING CODE FOUND (only intelligence collection scripts)

# Check for ML directories
find . -type d -name "ml" -o -name "models" -o -name "training" -o -name "neural"
# Result: ZERO ML/training directories exist

# Check BigQuery ML models
bq ls --models cbi-v14:forecasting_data_warehouse
# Result: 3 ARIMA models (created manually via console, not code)
```

### What EXISTS:
- ✅ `forecast/main.py` - FastAPI serving predictions (but no training code)
- ✅ 3 BigQuery ARIMA models (console-created, Oct 4-5, 2025)
- ✅ `master_intelligence_controller.py` - Data collection coordinator (mentions "neural network analysis" but doesn't implement it)
- ✅ Intelligence collection scripts (news, economic, social, Trump/ICE)

### What's MISSING:
- ❌ Feature engineering pipeline
- ❌ Label generation logic
- ❌ Training orchestrator (LightGBM, XGBoost, LSTM, Transformer)
- ❌ Model registry & versioning
- ❌ Walk-forward validation framework
- ❌ SHAP explainability implementation
- ❌ Backtesting infrastructure
- ❌ Retrain scheduler

**VERDICT:** Training pipelines are MISSING (0% implemented)

---

## 2. DATA CYCLE MAP

### Current State Flow:
```
Raw Ingestion → BigQuery Tables → (MISSING STEPS) → Predictions
    ✅              ✅                    ❌              ✅
```

### REQUIRED Complete Cycle:
```
1. Raw Ingestion          → PRESENT  (TradingEconomics scraper, NOAA, FRED, etc.)
2. Quality Validation     → PARTIAL  (basic schema checks, no systematic validation)
3. Normalization          → PARTIAL  (canonical schema designed, not fully implemented)
4. Feature Engineering    → MISSING  (no feature generation code)
5. Label Generation       → MISSING  (no target variable creation)
6. Feature Store          → MISSING  (no dedicated feature table)
7. Training               → MISSING  (no training orchestration)
8. Model Registry         → PARTIAL  (BigQuery stores ARIMA models, no versioning)
9. Validation (walk-fwd)  → MISSING  (no backtesting framework)
10. Inference             → PRESENT  (FastAPI serves predictions)
11. Monitoring            → MISSING  (no model drift detection)
12. Retrain Trigger       → MISSING  (no automated retraining)
```

### Data Cycle Status:
- **Steps 1-2:** OPERATIONAL (data flowing, basic checks)
- **Steps 3-9:** MISSING (feature engineering through validation)
- **Step 10:** OPERATIONAL (serving infrastructure exists)
- **Steps 11-12:** MISSING (monitoring & lifecycle management)

**GAP:** 70% of ML pipeline missing (7 out of 12 steps)

## 3. FEATURE READINESS INVENTORY

| Feature | Source Tables | Cadence | Completeness | Status |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------------|--------|
| ZL Price (close) | soybean_oil_prices | Daily | 100% (519 rows, 2023-2025) | ✅ READY |
| Weather (precip, temp) | weather_data | Daily | 100% (9,505 rows, 3 regions) | ✅ READY |
| USD/BRL FX | economic_indicators | Daily | 100% (494 rows) | ✅ READY |
| Fed Funds Rate | economic_indicators | Daily | 100% (731 rows) | ✅ READY |
| Crude Oil (WTI) | economic_indicators | Daily | 100% (487 rows) | ✅ READY |
| Trump/ICE Intelligence | ice_trump_intelligence | Event-driven | Partial (166 events) | 🟡 PARTIAL |
| **Palm Oil (FCPO)** | palm_oil_prices | Hourly | NEW (6 rows, just started) | 🟢 COLLECTING |
| **Soy-Palm Spread** | (computed) | MISSING | 0% (not calculated) | ❌ MISSING |
| **Crush Margin** | (computed) | MISSING | 0% (not calculated) | ❌ MISSING |
| **COT Positioning** | MISSING | MISSING | 0% (no CFTC data) | ❌ MISSING |
| **Freight Index** | commodity_prices_archive | NEW | 0% (scraper added, needs data) | 🟡 COLLECTING |
| **Social Sentiment** | social_sentiment | Daily | Sparse (20 rows) | 🟡 PARTIAL |

### Summary:
- **READY:** 5 core features (price, weather, FX, rates, crude)
- **COLLECTING:** 2 new features (palm oil, freight)
- **MISSING:** 5 critical features (spread, crush margin, COT, computed metrics)

---

## 4. LABELABILITY MATRIX

| Horizon | Labelable Now? | Required Data | Look-Ahead Risk |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1-day | YES | ZL daily close (exists) | LOW (next-day price available) |
| 7-day | YES | ZL daily close (exists) | MEDIUM (need careful train/test split) |
| 30-day | YES | ZL daily close (exists) | HIGH (must exclude last 30 days from training) |

### Current Label Generation:
- **Status:** MISSING
- **Target Variable:** Not defined in code
- **Calculation:** No script calculates `target_1d`, `target_7d`, `target_30d`
- **Look-Ahead Protection:** ABSENT (critical risk for data leakage)

### REQUIRED (Not Implemented):
```python
# Conceptual label generation (no actual code exists):
# target_1d = (price[t+1] - price[t]) / price[t]
# target_7d = (price[t+7] - price[t]) / price[t]
# 
# CRITICAL: Must ensure training data ends at (current_date - horizon)
# to avoid look-ahead bias
```

**VERDICT:** Labels can be generated but ZERO code exists. Look-ahead protection MISSING.

---

## 5. BACKTEST & VALIDATION READINESS

### Search Results:
```bash
# Search for backtest code
grep -r "backtest\|walk.forward\|time.series.split" cbi-v14-ingestion/ forecast/
# Result: NO BACKTEST CODE FOUND

# Search for validation frameworks
grep -r "cross_val\|TimeSeriesSplit\|train_test_split" .
# Result: ZERO validation code
```

### What EXISTS:
- ✅ BigQuery model `zl_arima_backtest` (console-created, no code)
- ✅ Table `backtest_forecast` (30 rows - results stored but no generation code)

### What's MISSING:
- ❌ Walk-forward validation framework
- ❌ Train/test split logic
- ❌ Out-of-sample evaluation metrics
- ❌ Backtesting orchestration
- ❌ Performance tracking over time

**VERDICT:** Backtest infrastructure MISSING (0% implemented)

### PROPOSE: Minimal Conceptual Backtest Plan

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Train on data[0:train_end], test on data[train_end:test_end]
2. Walk forward in 1-month increments
3. Calculate: MSE, directional accuracy, information ratio
4. Verify no future data leaked into features
5. SHAP values logged for each fold

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Data leakage (using future data in features)
- Look-ahead bias (labels use future prices without proper horizon offset)
- Survivor bias (only using current symbols, not historically available)
- Overfitting (too many features, not enough regularization)

---

## 6. MODEL REGISTRY & DEPLOYMENT

### Current State:
**Registry Type:** PARTIAL - BigQuery stores models but no versioning/metadata

**Evidence:**
```bash
# BigQuery ML models exist
bq ls --models cbi-v14:forecasting_data_warehouse
# Result: 3 ARIMA models (zl_arima_baseline, zl_arima_xreg, zl_arima_backtest)

# Check for MLflow/model registry
find . -name "mlruns" -o -name "models" -o -name ".mlflow"
# Result: NONE FOUND
```

### How forecast/main.py Selects Models:
```python
# PROVEN (from forecast/main.py):
# - Queries `soybean_oil_forecast` table for predictions
# - Does NOT load or select models
# - Models are trained manually via BigQuery console
# - Predictions pre-computed and stored in table
```

### What's MISSING:
- ❌ Model versioning (no v1, v2, v3 tracking)
- ❌ Model metadata (training date, features used, performance metrics)
- ❌ A/B testing infrastructure (cannot compare model versions)
- ❌ Model artifact storage (pickles, ONNX, saved weights)
- ❌ Automated model selection (always uses same model)

### RECOMMEND: Minimal Registry Approach

**Proposed Table (no code):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE ml_model_registry (
    model_id STRING,
    model_version STRING,
    model_type STRING,  -- 'ARIMA', 'LightGBM', 'XGBoost'
    training_date DATE,
    features_used JSON,
    train_mse FLOAT64,
    test_mse FLOAT64,
    directional_accuracy FLOAT64,
    artifact_path STRING,  -- GCS or local path
    is_production BOOL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Acceptance:** Model registry table exists and training script writes metadata after each training run.

---

## 7. OPERATIONAL READINESS CHECKLIST

### Scheduled Retrain Cadence:
- **Current:** NONE (models trained manually once, never retrained)
- **PROPOSE:** Weekly retrain on Sundays at 00:00 UTC
- **Trigger:** New palm oil data accumulates (>100 rows), or weekly timer

### Monitoring Metrics (PROPOSE to add):
| Metric | Current | Needed |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Data lag (hours since last ingest) | UNKNOWN | Alert if >24 hours |
| Percent null features | UNKNOWN | Alert if >5% |
| Rolling 7-day directional accuracy | UNKNOWN | Alert if <50% |
| Model drift (prediction vs actual divergence) | UNKNOWN | Alert if >20% |
| Feature distribution shift | UNKNOWN | Weekly KS-test |

**VERDICT:** NO operational monitoring exists. All metrics MISSING.

---

## PRIORITIZED 5-TASK BUILD PLAN (Conceptual - No Code)

### Task 1: Feature Engineering Pipeline
**Owner:** data-eng  
**Estimated Hours:** 8-12  
**Owner Approval Required:** TRUE  

**Conceptual Steps:**
1. Create `forecast/feature_engineering.py` to compute derived features
2. Calculate: crush_margin, soy_palm_spread, palm_percentile_regime
3. Join weather (7d/30d avg), macro (FX, rates), sentiment (Trump/ICE scores with decay)
4. Store in feature table or materialized view
5. Schedule: Daily at 02:00 UTC (after data ingestion completes)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Feature table contains >=50 features
- [ ] >=95% non-null values for previous 90 days
- [ ] All features timestamped with `feature_date` and `computed_at`
- [ ] Query: `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT feature_date) FROM features WHERE feature_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 90 DAY)` returns >=85

**Rollback:** Drop feature table if validation fails

**Cost:** $0.05/month (BigQuery compute + storage)

---

### Task 2: Label Generation & Look-Ahead Safety
**Owner:** quant  
**Estimated Hours:** 4-6  
**Owner Approval Required:** TRUE  

**Conceptual Steps:**
1. Define target horizons: 1d, 7d, 30d price changes
2. Implement forward-looking label calculation with horizon offset
3. Add look-ahead protection: training data ends at (current_date - max_horizon)
4. Store labels in `ml_labels` table or join with features
5. Synthetic test: Verify future data NOT used in past labels

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Label generation script exists
- [ ] Synthetic test passes: labels[date=X] do NOT reference prices[date>X]
- [ ] Sample backtest query can join features[t] with labels[t] without leakage
- [ ] Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ml_labels WHERE label_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY)` returns 0 (proves look-ahead protection)

**Rollback:** N/A (read-only label calculation)

**Cost:** $0/month

---

### Task 3: Training Job Orchestrator
**Owner:** ml-eng  
**Estimated Hours:** 12-16  
**Owner Approval Required:** TRUE  

**Conceptual Steps:**
1. Decide execution environment: Local Python vs BigQuery ML vs Cloud Run
2. Define training job inputs: feature_table, label_table, config_params
3. Define outputs: model artifact (pickle/ONNX), metadata (registry entry)
4. Implement triggering: Cron (weekly) or manual script execution
5. Save model to GCS or local, write metadata to `ml_model_registry` table

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Training job can be triggered manually: `python3 forecast/train_model.py`
- [ ] Produces model artifact file with timestamp
- [ ] Writes metadata row to `ml_model_registry`
- [ ] Model artifact can be loaded and used for inference
- [ ] Total execution time <30 minutes for 2-year dataset

**Rollback:** Delete model artifacts, drop registry row

**Cost:** $0-2/month (local training = $0, Cloud Run = $1-2/month)

---

### Task 4: Baseline LightGBM Experiment
**Owner:** quant  
**Estimated Hours:** 16-24  
**Owner Approval Required:** TRUE  

**Conceptual Steps:**
1. Define feature set: <=50 features (weather, macro, palm spread, sentiment)
2. Define data window: 2 years (2023-2025)
3. Implement walk-forward validation: 6-month train, 1-month test, rolling
4. Train LightGBM: n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=5
5. Evaluate: MSE, directional accuracy (>55% target), information ratio
6. Compute SHAP: Top 10 features per prediction
7. Compare to naive baseline (previous day's price, seasonal average)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Model trains successfully on 2-year dataset
- [ ] Out-of-sample directional accuracy > 55% (beats coin flip)
- [ ] Improvement over naive baseline: >=5% directional accuracy gain
- [ ] SHAP feature importance stable across 5 folds (top 10 features consistent)
- [ ] Model artifacts saved with metadata
- [ ] Inference script produces predictions for next 7 days

**Rollback:** Archive model, don't deploy to production

**Cost:** $0/month (local training on laptop/workstation)

---

### Task 5: Monitoring & Retrain Policy
**Owner:** ops/quant  
**Estimated Hours:** 6-8  
**Owner Approval Required:** TRUE  

**Conceptual Steps:**
1. Define monitoring metrics: data lag, null rates, rolling accuracy, drift
2. Implement metric calculation: Daily cron job queries BigQuery
3. Set alert thresholds: >24h lag, >5% nulls, <50% accuracy, >20% drift
4. Define retrain triggers: Weekly schedule OR accuracy drops below 50%
5. Create monitoring dashboard (Vite or simple BigQuery view)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Monitoring queries run daily and save metrics to `ml_monitoring` table
- [ ] Alert fires on synthetic bad data (test: inject nulls >5%)
- [ ] Retrain trigger documented: "If accuracy <50% for 3 days, retrain immediately"
- [ ] Dashboard shows: last_train_date, current_accuracy, data_lag_hours, null_rate
- [ ] Query: `SELECT * FROM ml_monitoring ORDER BY check_date DESC LIMIT 7` returns 7 daily check results

**Rollback:** Disable monitoring cron job

**Cost:** $0.05/month (BigQuery queries)

## TOP 5 RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk 1: Data Leakage (Look-Ahead Bias)
**Impact:** HIGH - Models appear accurate but fail in production  
**Mitigation:** Implement synthetic tests that verify labels[t] don't use data[t+horizon]  
**Owner Action:** quant must design and run leakage tests before training

### Risk 2: Insufficient Palm Oil Data
**Impact:** HIGH - Can't train palm spread features without 90+ days data  
**Mitigation:** Run TradingEconomics scraper for 7-14 days before attempting ML training  
**Owner Action:** Wait for data accumulation, set calendar reminder for Oct 14

### Risk 3: Feature Engineering Complexity
**Impact:** MEDIUM - 50+ features may overfit small dataset  
**Mitigation:** Start with 20-30 core features, add incrementally with cross-validation  
**Owner Action:** quant prioritizes features by univariate correlation with target

### Risk 4: No Model Registry
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Can't track which model version produced which prediction  
**Mitigation:** Create `ml_model_registry` table BEFORE first training run  
**Owner Action:** Request permission for new table, create with approval

### Risk 5: Training Cost Uncertainty
**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM - Don't know if local training suffices or need cloud  
**Mitigation:** Start local (2-year dataset, 50 features = <5GB RAM), scale to cloud if needed  
**Owner Action:** Test training locally first, monitor RAM usage

---

## IMMEDIATE "DO THIS NEXT" LIST

### Action 1: **WAIT for Palm Oil Data Accumulation (7-14 days)**
**Why:** Cannot train palm spread features with only 6 rows  
**Who:** Automated (TradingEconomics scraper running hourly)  
**Verification:** `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM palm_oil_prices` should be >100 before training  
**Timeline:** Check again Oct 14-21, 2025

### Action 2: **Create Feature Engineering Plan (Not Code)**
**Why:** Need to define which 50 features to engineer before building pipeline  
**Who:** Owner/quant must decide  
**Verification:** Document approved in `FEATURE_ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`  
**Timeline:** Next 2-4 hours (user decision)  
**Owner Approval Required:** TRUE

### Action 3: **Investigate BigQuery ML vs Local Training Decision**
**Why:** Don't know if current ARIMA approach extends to ensemble or need Python  
**Who:** Owner must decide: BigQuery BOOSTED_TREE vs local LightGBM  
**Verification:** Decision documented in plan.md  
**Cost Impact:** BigQuery ML = $0.10-0.50/month, Local = $0/month  
**Owner Approval Required:** TRUE

---

## UNKNOWN ITEMS (Require Single-Step Checks)

### UNKNOWN 1: Feature Table Schema
**Question:** Does a feature table or view already exist?  
**Check:** `bq ls cbi-v14:forecasting_data_warehouse | grep feature`  
**Owner Action:** Run check and report result

### UNKNOWN 2: Training Data Volume
**Question:** How many rows of complete (all features non-null) training data exist?  
**Check:** `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM soybean_oil_prices s JOIN weather_data w ON DATE(s.time) = w.date WHERE s.close IS NOT NULL AND w.precip_mm IS NOT NULL`  
**Owner Action:** Run query to understand training dataset size

### UNKNOWN 3: Compute Environment
**Question:** Where will training jobs run? (local laptop, GCP VM, Cloud Run, BigQuery ML)  
**Check:** Owner decision based on dataset size and budget  
**Owner Action:** Decide and document in plan.md

## NEXT_STEP_FOR_OWNER

**Immediate (Next 2-4 Hours):**
1. **DECISION REQUIRED:** BigQuery ML (BOOSTED_TREE) vs Local Python (LightGBM)?
   - BigQuery ML: Easier, managed, ~$0.50/month
   - Local Python: Full control, $0/month, requires orchestration
