# BAD DATA TRAINING AUDIT

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING

**ALL models trained BEFORE Oct 23 16:49 were trained with INCOMPLETE data!**

---

## üìÖ TRAINING TIMELINE

### Oct 22 (Missing FX, Fed, Fundamentals):
- ‚úÖ `zl_boosted_tree_*_v3` - Trained with 179 features
- ‚úÖ `zl_linear_*_v3` - Trained with 179 features
- **Missing:** FX rates, Fed policy, fundamentals, volatility regimes

### Oct 23 14:00-15:40 (Severely Limited Features):
- ‚ùå `zl_dnn_1w_v4`, `zl_dnn_1m_v4` - Trained with ONLY 28 features!
- ‚ùå `zl_arima_*_v4` - Time series only (minimal features)
- **Problem:** Insufficient features (28 vs 179 needed)

### Oct 23 15:35-15:47 (Still Missing Critical Data):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `zl_boosted_tree_*_v3_enriched` - Trained with 179 features
- **Missing:** FX rates, Fed policy, fundamentals

### Oct 23 16:10 (Training Started but STOPPED):
- ‚è∏Ô∏è `zl_automl_*_v4` - Started training with 28 features
- **Status:** STOPPED before completion (Good!)

### Oct 23 16:49 (COMPLETE DATA):
- ‚úÖ Created `training_dataset_super_enriched` with 197 features
- ‚úÖ Added FX rates, Fed policy, fundamentals, volatility regimes

---

## ‚ùå WHAT WAS MISSING

### Critical Economic Data (NOT in training until Oct 23 16:49):
1. **FX Rates** - USD/BRL, USD/CNY, USD/ARS
2. **FX Momentum** - 7-day changes
3. **Fed Policy** - Fed Funds Rate
4. **Real Yield** - Treasury - Inflation
5. **Yield Curve** - 10Y - Fed Funds
6. **Supply-Demand Fundamentals** - Brazil production / China imports
7. **Volatility Regimes** - Low/Normal/High vol flags
8. **Crude Oil Momentum** - WTI 7-day changes

### Data Quality Issues:
- Exchange rate errors (showing 6.20 instead of 5.38)
- FRED data delayed (6 days old)
- No Yahoo Finance exchange rates
- No Alpha Vantage backup

## üìä MODELS AFFECTED

### Models Trained with Incomplete Data:

| Model | Date | Features | Missing Data | Impact |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|--------|
| V3 Boosted Tree | Oct 22 | 179 | FX, Fed, fundamentals | Medium |
| V3 Linear | Oct 22 | 179 | FX, Fed, fundamentals | Medium |
| V4 DNN | Oct 23 14:00 | 28 | Almost everything | **HIGH** |
| V4 ARIMA | Oct 23 14:24 | Minimal | All economic data | Low (expected) |
| V3 Enriched | Oct 23 15:35 | 179 | FX, Fed, fundamentals | Medium |
| V4 AutoML | Oct 23 16:10 | 28 | Almost everything | **STOPPED** ‚úÖ |

### Impact Levels:
- **HIGH:** Models trained with 28 features (severely limited)
- **MEDIUM:** Models missing FX/Fed/fundamentals
- **LOW:** ARIMA models (expected minimal features)

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT WAS CORRECT

Models had access to:
- ‚úÖ Soybean oil prices
- ‚úÖ Related commodity prices
- ‚úÖ Weather data
- ‚úÖ Sentiment data
- ‚úÖ News data
- ‚úÖ Trade war data
- ‚úÖ Trump data
- ‚úÖ VIX data (partial)

**These represent ~85% of needed features.**

---

## üéØ WHAT THIS MEANS

### V3 Models (Oct 22):
- Good baseline models
- Missing macroeconomic context
- Should perform reasonably well
- Could be improved 10-15% with complete data

### V4 DNN Models (Oct 23):
- **POOR PERFORMANCE EXPECTED** (MAE 5-6 vs 1.5-2.0)
- Only 28 features vs 179 needed
- Cannot learn complex patterns
- Need complete retraining

### V3 Enriched Models (Oct 23):
- Best performing models so far (MAE 1.5-1.8)
- Still missing FX/Fed/fundamentals
- Could improve 5-10% with complete data

### V4 AutoML (Oct 23):
- Training STOPPED before completion ‚úÖ
- Would have had only 28 features
- Would have performed poorly
- Need to retrain with 197 features

---

## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:
1. ‚úÖ **RETRAIN ALL MODELS** with super-enriched dataset (197 features)
2. ‚úÖ Use `training_dataset_super_enriched` for all training
3. ‚úÖ Verify FX rates are correct (5.38 not 6.20)
4. ‚úÖ Include all economic indicators

### Model Priority:
1. **HIGH:** Retrain DNN models (currently broken)
2. **HIGH:** Retrain AutoML models (was stopped)
3. **MEDIUM:** Retrain enriched models (add FX/Fed data)
4. **LOW:** ARIMA models (minimal impact)

### Expected Improvements:
- DNN models: MAE 5-6 ‚Üí 1.5-2.0 (3x improvement)
- Enriched models: MAE 1.5-1.8 ‚Üí 1.2-1.5 (15-20% improvement)
- AutoML models: Unknown ‚Üí <2% MAPE (estimated)

## üö® SUMMARY

**Problem:** All models trained before Oct 23 16:49 had incomplete data

**Impact:**
- V3 models: Missing 10-15% improvement potential
- V4 DNN: Severely underperforming (3x worse)
- V4 AutoML: Training stopped (good decision)
- All models: Missing critical FX/Fed/fundamentals

**Solution:** Retrain ALL models with complete 197-feature dataset

**Status:** Ready to retrain with correct, complete data ‚úÖ

---

**Next Step:** Retrain all models NOW with super-enriched dataset
