# News Data Integration Status

## Overview
Successfully collected comprehensive news data from multiple sources and prepared integration into training dataset.

## Data Collected

### 1. News Advanced Table (`news_advanced`)
- **Total Articles**: 223

- **Unique Days**: 16 days of coverage
- **Average Content Length**: 4,991 characters
- **High Relevance Articles**: 8 articles
- **Keywords Tracked**: soybean oil, tariffs, China, Brazil, legislation, lobbying, weather, biofuel

### 2. News Ultra-Aggressive Table (`news_ultra_aggressive`)
- **Total Articles**: 15
- **Sources**: DTN Progressive Farmer, Reuters (scraped)
- **Unique Days**: 2 days of coverage
- **Average Content Length**: 4,846 characters

## Integration Status

### Completed ✅
1. ✅ Created comprehensive data acquisition system with multiple strategies
2. ✅ Collected 238 total articles from diverse sources
3. ✅ Extracted full content (not just headlines)
4. ✅ Analyzed correlations (tariffs, China, Brazil, legislation, etc.)
5. ✅ Calculated relevance scores and sentiment
6. ✅ Saved to BigQuery staging tables

### Blocked ❌
- **Issue**: BigQuery sandbox mode restrictions
- **Error**: "Datasets must have a default expiration time and default partition expiration time of less than 60 days"
- **Attempted Fixes**:
  - Set dataset-level expiration to 55 days ✓
  - Removed table-level partition_expiration_days ✓
  - Tried creating views instead of tables ✗
  - **All attempts failed** - The sandbox restrictions are applied at execution time

## What We Have Ready

### Features Prepared (23+ new features):
1. **News Volume Metrics**:
   - `news_total_count` - Total articles per day
   - `news_source_count` - Unique sources per day
   - `news_high_relevance_count` - Critical/high relevance articles

2. **Topic-Specific Features**:
   - Soybean oil mentions/articles
   - Tariff mentions/articles/avg_score
   - China mentions/articles/sentiment
   - Brazil mentions/articles
   - Legislation mentions/articles
   - Lobbying mentions/articles
   - Weather mentions/articles
   - Biofuel mentions/articles

3. **Sentiment & Quality**:
   - `news_avg_sentiment` - Average sentiment score
   - `news_sentiment_volatility` - Sentiment variance
   - `news_avg_relevance_score` - Article quality score
   - `news_avg_content_length` - Content depth metric

4. **Trend Indicators**:
   - 7-day moving averages for counts and mentions
   - Spike detection for unusual activity

## Current Training Dataset

### Existing Features: 172
- Price/lag structure (zl_price_*, return_*, ma_*)
- Correlation features (28 corr_* features)
- Engineered features (8 feature_* features)
- CFTC positioning (7 cftc_* features)
- China/Brazil intelligence (china_*, brazil_*)
- Weather data (weather_*)
- Existing news: `news_article_count`, `news_avg_score`

### Ready to Add: 23+ news features
Total would be: **195+ features** with news integration

## Next Steps Required

### Option 1: Manual SQL Execution
Execute the integration SQL directly in BigQuery console (bypasses Python client restrictions):
```sql
-- Run Step 1 and Step 2 queries from integrate_news_into_training.py
-- in BigQuery console
```

### Option 2: Wait for Billing
Enable billing on the GCP project to remove sandbox restrictions

### Option 3: Alternative Approach
Use Python to query news tables directly in model training without creating intermediate tables

## Key Insight

The news data successfully fills the gaps identified:
- ✅ Tariff coverage (legislation, trade war)
- ✅ China trade relations
- ✅ Brazil/Argentina production news
- ✅ Industry-specific sources (Bloomberg, Farm Progress)
- ✅ Alternative data (Reddit sentiment)
- ✅ Full article content (not just summaries)

**The data is ready - we just need to resolve the BigQuery sandbox integration issue.**
