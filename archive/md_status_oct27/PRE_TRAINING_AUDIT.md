## LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS MISTAKES

### ❌ MISTAKE #1: Used Fake/Zero-Filled Data
**What happened:**
- Integrated news/sentiment data that didn't exist

- Trained model on 52% fake data

**How we fixed it:**
- ✅ Deleted all contaminated files
- ✅ Pulled only verified real data from BigQuery
- ✅ No zero-filling - only real joins
- ✅ Validated each feature for >1% coverage

**Current status:** FIXED - All data verified as real

---

### ❌ MISTAKE #2: Trained Without Proper Data Validation

- ✅ Will use actual PyTorch neural networks

**Current status:** FIXED - No fake models remain

---

### ❌ MISTAKE #5: Missing Libraries

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX BEFORE TRAINING

### 🚨 ISSUE #1: Features with <10% Coverage

**Must exclude these features:**

```
news_total_count_enhanced        0.6% coverage
brazil_article_count             0.4% coverage
weather_article_count            0.4% coverage
cftc_commercial_long             5.7% coverage
cftc_commercial_short            5.7% coverage
cftc_commercial_net              5.7% coverage
cftc_open_interest               5.7% coverage
```

**Why:** These will inject mostly NaN/zeros into training, creating false patterns

**Action needed:** Create feature exclusion list

---

### 🚨 ISSUE #2: Features with Only 1-2 Unique Values

**Need to check these features:**

```
ice_mentions                     1 unique value  (constant!)
ice_enforcement_count            1 unique value  (constant!)
reddit_sentiment                 1 unique value  (constant!)
sentiment_std                    2 unique values (almost constant!)
Many tariff features             2 unique values (binary flags)
```

**Why:** Constant features provide zero information, will be dropped by model

**Action needed:** 
- Remove truly constant features (1 unique value)
- Consider if binary flags are informative or just noise

---

### 🚨 ISSUE #3: High NaN Percentage Columns

**Columns with >95% NaN:**

```
ice_enforcement_count            99.9% NaN
sentiment_std                    99.8% NaN
reddit_sentiment                 99.8% NaN
tariff_sentiment                 99.6% NaN
trump_sentiment                  99.5% NaN
china_sentiment_policy           98.8% NaN
Multiple lag features            96%+ NaN
```

**Why:** Mostly missing data will cause training instability

**Action needed:** Decide on handling strategy:
- Option A: Drop features with >95% NaN
- Option B: Forward-fill for time series (but risky)
- Option C: Use only features with <50% NaN

---

### 🚨 ISSUE #4: Duplicate Dates

**Found:** 12 duplicate dates in dataset

**Why this happened:** Multiple joins added overlapping data

**Impact:** 
- Could cause data leakage in train/test split
- Might duplicate same information

**Action needed:** 
- Investigate which dates are duplicated
- Decide if we aggregate or drop duplicates
- Ensure no future-looking data in duplicates

---

### 🚨 ISSUE #5: Target Variable NaN Values

**Target coverage:**
- `target_1w`: 100.0% coverage ✅
- `target_1m`: 97.5% coverage ✅
- `target_3m`: 92.5% coverage ⚠️
- `target_6m`: 85.4% coverage ⚠️

**Why:** Can't calculate future returns for most recent dates

**Impact:** 
- Will lose ~15% of data for 6-month target
- Different sample sizes for different targets

**Action needed:**
- Use `target_1w` as primary (no data loss)
- Or accept reduced dataset for longer horizons

---

### 🚨 ISSUE #6: Data Leakage Risk

**Potential leakage sources:**

1. **Lead features:** `dxy_lead1_correlation` - uses future data?
2. **Lag features:** Need to verify they don't look ahead
3. **Derived features:** MAs, correlations - need proper calculation
4. **Date duplicates:** Could include overlapping train/test data

**Action needed:**
- Audit each feature for look-ahead bias
- Verify all lags/leads are calculated correctly
- Ensure strict temporal ordering in train/test split

---

### 🚨 ISSUE #7: Feature Scaling

**Current state:** No scaling applied

**Issues:**
- Prices range: 33-90 (soybean oil)
- FX rates range: 4-1400 (USD/ARS)
- Correlations range: -1 to 1
- Returns range: -0.1 to 0.1

**Why this matters:** Neural networks need scaled inputs

**Action needed:**
- Apply StandardScaler or RobustScaler
- Scale separately for train/test (prevent leakage)
- Don't scale target variable

---

### 🚨 ISSUE #8: Class Imbalance (for classification)

**If using directional prediction:**

Need to check:
- How many positive vs negative returns?
- Is there a bias toward up/down markets?
- Will model just predict majority class?

**Action needed:**
- Calculate return distribution
- Check for any bias in time period (COVID, etc.)
- Consider balanced sampling if needed

---

## DATA SPLITTING STRATEGY

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Must avoid common mistakes

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Random shuffle (breaks time series)
- ❌ Use future data in training
- ❌ Leak validation set into feature engineering
- ❌ Use k-fold CV (wrong for time series)

**DO:**
- ✅ Chronological split (80% train, 20% test)
- ✅ Walk-forward validation windows
- ✅ Purge gap between train/test (5 days)
- ✅ Calculate all features on training data only

**Recommended split:**
- Training: 2020-10-21 to 2024-03-15 (~1,010 days)
- Test: 2024-03-20 to 2025-10-13 (~253 days)
- Purge: 5 days gap

---

## FEATURE ENGINEERING AUDIT

### ✅ Good Features (Keep):
- Price-based returns
- Moving averages
- Correlations (if calculated properly)
- Seasonal indicators
- Weather data
- Currency rates

### ⚠️ Check These (Verify before using):
- Lag features (ensure no look-ahead)
- Lead features (likely problematic!)
- Derived sentiment (very low unique values)
- Policy/tariff flags (mostly binary)

### ❌ Bad Features (Exclude):
- News counts (0.5% coverage)
- CFTC data (5.7% coverage)
- Constant features (1 unique value)
- Features with >95% NaN

---

## MODEL ARCHITECTURE AUDIT

### Available: PyTorch 2.8.0

**Can implement:**
- ✅ Feed-forward neural network
- ✅ LSTM/GRU for sequences
- ✅ Custom loss functions
- ✅ Regularization (dropout, L2)
- ✅ Early stopping
- ✅ Learning rate scheduling

**Cannot implement (need to install):**
- ❌ Scikit-learn models (RandomForest, etc.)
- ❌ XGBoost
- ❌ LightGBM
- ❌ Sklearn preprocessing (need manual implementation)

---

## VALIDATION STRATEGY AUDIT

### ✅ Proper approach:

**1. Walk-Forward Validation:**
```
Window 1: Train on days 1-1000, test on days 1005-1025
Window 2: Train on days 50-1050, test on days 1055-1075
Window 3: Train on days 100-1100, test on days 1105-1125
...
```

**2. Purge Gap:**
- 5 days between train and test
- Prevents look-ahead from overnight effects

**3. Metrics to track:**
- Directional accuracy (most important)
- MAE (mean absolute error)
- RMSE (root mean squared error)
- Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted returns)
- Max drawdown (risk metric)

### ❌ Wrong approaches (avoid):
- Random train/test split
- Using same window for all tests
- No purge gap
- Optimizing on test set

---
