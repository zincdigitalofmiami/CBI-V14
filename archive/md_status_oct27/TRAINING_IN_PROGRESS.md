## üéØ WHAT HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY

1. **Sequential Training**: Models train one at a time
2. **Auto-Evaluation**: BQML evaluates each model after training
3. **Metrics Logged**: MAE, RMSE, R¬≤ recorded
4. **Feature Importance**: Calculated for each model
5. **Results Saved**: All metrics logged to tracking table

---

## üìã WHEN TRAINING COMPLETES

You'll have:
- ‚úÖ 16 trained production models
- ‚úÖ Complete performance metrics across all horizons
- ‚úÖ Feature importance analysis
- ‚úÖ Model comparison data
- ‚úÖ Ready for production deployment

### Next Steps After Completion:
1. Analyze performance across models
2. Select best model per horizon
3. Deploy to API endpoints
4. Wire to dashboard
5. Set up monitoring

## üîç MONITOR TRAINING

### Check Progress:
```bash
python3 scripts/monitor_training_progress.py
```

### Quick Status:
```bash
bq ls --models cbi-v14:models | grep "_v1" | wc -l
```

### View Training Log:
```bash
tail -f logs/full_training_output.log
```
