## 📊 BASELINE PERFORMANCE

**Linear Regression** (simplest model):
- MAE: 14.25
- RMSE: 15.24  
- On ~$50 price = **~28% error**

**Target** (institutional-grade):
- MAE: < 3.0
- MAPE: < 5%
- **Need**: Better models (DNN optimization, Boosted Trees, Ensemble)

---

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Performance Improvement):
1. Train Boosted Tree model (typically best for tabular data)
2. Hyperparameter-tune DNN (wider/deeper networks)
3. Evaluate DNN baseline results (when internal training completes)

### Short-Term (Complete Coverage):
1. Train models for other horizons (1m, 3m, 6m)
2. Compare performance across model types
3. Select best model per horizon

### Production (Deployment):
1. Wire best models to API
2. Set up daily refresh of feature tables
3. Implement monitoring and alerting
4. Deploy to dashboard
