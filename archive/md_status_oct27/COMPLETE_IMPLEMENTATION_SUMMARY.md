## 💡 INITIAL BASELINE RESULTS

### Linear Regression Performance:
- **MAE: 14.25** (baseline metric)
- **RMSE: 15.24**
- **R²: -1.04** (indicates simple linear model insufficient)

**Interpretation**: 
- Baseline MAE of $14.25 on 1-week forecasts
- With current price ~$45-55, this is ~25-30% error
- Negative R² confirms need for non-linear models
- This establishes the performance floor to beat

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Option A: Train Multi-Horizon Models
Train baseline models for all 4 horizons (1w, 1m, 3m, 6m):
- 4 ARIMA models
- 4 Linear Regression models  
- 4 DNN models
**Total**: 12 baseline models

### Option B: Optimize 1-Week Model First
Focus on improving 1-week forecasts:
- Tune DNN hyperparameters (wider/deeper networks)
- Train Boosted Tree models
- Implement ensemble
- Then expand to other horizons

### Option C: Full Production Suite
Train complete model suite:
- 16 models (4 horizons × 4 model types)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Ensemble models
- Production deployment
