## 🚨 THE ONE BLOCKER

**Issue:** Duplicate dates in training dataset (128 rows for 2025-10-22)  
**Cause:** `vw_seasonality_features` returns 2,024 rows per date  
**Fix:** 15-30 minutes  
**Impact:** Training will fail without fix

---

## ✅ EVERYTHING ELSE IS READY

- ✅ 1,385 rows training data (2020-2025)
- ✅ 4 targets (1w, 1m, 3m, 6m) - 12m removed per user
- ✅ 0% NaN in crude correlations
- ✅ 12 feature views working
- ✅ Big 8 signals healthy
- ✅ GCP access verified
- ✅ $7-19 cost estimate (well within budget)
- ✅ No running jobs

---

## ⚠️ NON-BLOCKING ITEMS

- 9 scripts reference removed 12m (won't affect training)
- 2 unused views should be deleted (cost optimization)
- readiness script needs 12m check removed

---

## 🎯 READY TO TRAIN

**Once blocker fixed:**
- 16 models (4 horizons × 4 algorithms)
- LightGBM, DNN, ARIMA, Linear
- Expected MAPE: 3-5%
- Expected accuracy: 65-70%
- Time: 2-4 hours
- Cost: $7-19

## 🔧 FIX COMMAND

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `cbi-v14.models.vw_seasonality_features` AS
SELECT 
    date,
    AVG(seasonal_index) as seasonal_index,
    AVG(monthly_zscore) as monthly_zscore,
    AVG(yoy_change) as yoy_change,
    APPROX_TOP_COUNT(agricultural_phase, 1)[OFFSET(0)].value as agricultural_phase
FROM (/* existing query */)
GROUP BY date
```

---

## ✅ VERIFY FIX

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
client = bigquery.Client(project='cbi-v14')
result = list(client.query("""
    SELECT date, COUNT(*) as cnt 
    FROM `cbi-v14.models.vw_neural_training_dataset`
    GROUP BY date HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
""").result())
print("✅ FIXED!" if not result else f"❌ Still {len(result)} duplicates")
```

**Bottom Line:** Fix 1 view → Verify → Train 16 models → Done! 🚀
