# COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP AND TRAINING PLAN
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** Ready to Execute

## âœ… UNDERSTANDING THE REAL SITUATION

### What We Learned:
1. **Soybean, Soybean Oil, Soybean Meal are DIFFERENT commodities**
   - Soybeans (ZS): ~$1,300/bushel
   - Soybean Oil (ZL): ~$55/cwt  
   - Soybean Meal (ZM): ~$380/ton
   - **These are NOT duplicates - keep separate!**

2. **Most data is from Yahoo Finance (good!)**
   - 11 tables from Yahoo (reliable, consistent OHLCV)
   - 8 tables unknown source (need investigation)

3. **Schema inconsistencies exist**
   - crude_oil_prices has different column names (date vs time, close_price vs close)
   - Need standardization for joins

4. **Data gaps: ~30% missing** (570 days missing from 1,828 day range)

## ðŸ§¹ CLEANUP PLAN (SURGICAL, NOT DESTRUCTIVE)

### Phase 1: Delete TRUE Duplicates and Empty Tables
```sql
-- Delete empty tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.biofuel_metrics`;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.extraction_labels`;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.harvest_progress`;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.weather_paraguay_daily`;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.weather_uruguay_daily`;

-- Delete old/obsolete
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.soybean_oil_forecast`; -- Old forecast, only 30 rows

-- Delete entire staging_ml dataset (temporary)
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS `cbi-v14.staging_ml` CASCADE;
```

### Phase 2: Move Views to Proper Location
```sql
-- Move all vw_* from forecasting_data_warehouse to signals
-- Examples:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `cbi-v14.signals.vw_soybean_oil_daily_clean` AS
SELECT * FROM `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.vw_soybean_oil_daily_clean`;

-- Then drop from warehouse
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.vw_soybean_oil_daily_clean`;
```

### Phase 3: Standardize Schemas
```sql
-- Fix crude_oil_prices to match other commodities
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.crude_oil_prices_standardized` AS
SELECT 
    date as time,  -- Rename date to time
    symbol,
    NULL as open,  -- Add missing OHLC columns
    NULL as high,
    NULL as low,
    close_price as close,  -- Rename close_price to close
    volume,
    source_name,
    confidence_score,
    ingest_timestamp_utc,
    provenance_uuid
FROM `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.crude_oil_prices`;
```

- **Clear separation**: Raw data in warehouse, views in signals
- **Standardized schemas** for proper joins
- **No empty tables**

### Training Dataset:
- **200+ features** (currently only 159)
- **ALL commodities** included
- **ALL market intelligence** (sentiment, VIX, CFTC)
- **ALL fundamentals** (exports, crush margins, positioning)
- **Complete weather** by region
- **Full technical indicators**
- **Cross-asset correlations**

### Model Performance:
- **Expected MAE: < 1.0** (currently 1.19-1.58)
- **Expected RÂ²: > 0.98** (currently 0.96-0.98)
- **Better regime detection** with VIX and positioning
- **Better shock prediction** with policy and sentiment

## ðŸš€ EXECUTION STEPS

1. **Backup first** (just in case)
2. **Run cleanup script** (delete only true duplicates)
3. **Reorganize views** (move to signals)
4. **Standardize schemas** (fix column names)
5. **Create master training dataset** (with ALL features)
6. **Retrain models** (Boosted Trees with complete data)
7. **Deploy to production**

**This is a SURGICAL cleanup - we're NOT destroying data, just organizing it properly!**
