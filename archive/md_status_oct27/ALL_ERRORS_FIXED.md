# ALL ERRORS FIXED - READY FOR TRAINING
**Date:** October 22, 2025 - Evening  
**Status:** ✅ **GREEN LIGHT FOR TRAINING**

---

## 🎯 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

All pre-training audit issues have been **RESOLVED**:

### ✅ Issues Fixed:

1. **Duplicate Dates** (BLOCKER)
   - ❌ Was: 128 duplicate rows for 2025-10-22
   - ✅ Fixed: `vw_seasonality_features` now aggregates to 1 row per date
   - ✅ Result: Training dataset has perfect 1:1 row-to-date ratio

2. **Invalid Column References**
   - ❌ Was: `harvest_pressure` and `china_demand_multiplier` from wrong view
   - ✅ Fixed: Recreated `vw_neural_training_dataset` with correct column mapping
   - ✅ Result: View queries successfully, no errors

3. **NaN Values in Correlations**
   - ✅ Verified: 0% NaN in `corr_zl_crude_7d` and `corr_zl_crude_30d`
   - ✅ All COALESCE guards working properly

4. **MASTER_TRAINING_PLAN.md Updated**
   - ✅ Date updated to October 22, 2025
   - ✅ Status changed to "READY TO FIX & TRAIN"
   - ✅ Removed 12m references (4 horizons only: 1w, 1m, 3m, 6m)
   - ✅ Updated training status with audit results
