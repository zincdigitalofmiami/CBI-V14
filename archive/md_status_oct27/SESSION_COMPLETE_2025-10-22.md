## 🎯 PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS

### Linear Regression Baseline:
- **MAE: ~14.25** (on 1-week forecast)
- This is the floor to beat

### Expected After Training:
- **Boosted Tree**: MAE 5-8 (typically best for tabular)
- **DNN**: MAE 3-6 (if properly tuned)
- **ARIMA Plus**: MAE 8-12 (time series specialist)
- **Ensemble**: MAE 2-4 (combining best models)

### Target (Institutional Grade):
- **MAE < 3.0** (< 5% error on $60 price)
- **MAPE < 5%**
- **Directional accuracy > 65%**
