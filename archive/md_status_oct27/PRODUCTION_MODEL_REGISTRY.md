## üö´ ARCHIVED MODELS (DO NOT USE)

### V5 Enhanced Models (Failed Experiment)
- `zl_boosted_tree_1w_v5_enhanced` - MAPE 5.38% (worse than V4)
- **Issue:** 145 features introduced noise, degraded performance
- **Status:** ‚ùå ARCHIVED - Reference only

### Experimental Models (Unverified)
- Any model with MAE ~$0.99-1.23 (internal experiments, not production)
- **Status:** ‚ùå UNVERIFIED - Require validation

## üîß PRODUCTION VALIDATION CHECKLIST

### Pre-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Model ID matches registry exactly
- [ ] Feature count = 62 columns
- [ ] Training date = Oct 23, 2025
- [ ] MAPE within expected range (2.1-3.6%)
- [ ] Dataset source verified

### Runtime Checks
```sql
-- Verify model exists and is correct version
SELECT model_id, created, model_type 
FROM `cbi-v14.models.__MODELS__` 
WHERE model_id = 'zl_boosted_tree_1m_v3_enriched'
  AND created = '2025-10-23'
```

### Feature Validation
```python
# Verify feature count in production
expected_features = 62
actual_features = len(model.feature_columns)
assert actual_features == expected_features, f"Feature mismatch: {actual_features} != {expected_features}"
```

## üìà PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Simple Ensemble (Week 1)
**Target:** Reduce MAPE by 0.3-0.5 percentage points

1. **Dynamic Weighting System**
   - 30-day rolling performance window
   - Weight = `exp(1/recent_mape)` normalized
   - Update weights daily

2. **Statistical Validation Layer**
   - Z-score bounds: Flag predictions > 3œÉ
   - Commodity constraints: Physical price limits
   - Extreme prediction blending with simpler models

### Phase 2: Regime Detection (Week 2)
**Target:** 10-15% accuracy improvement during transitions

1. **Two-Regime System**
   - High volatility: VIX > 80th percentile
   - Low volatility: VIX ‚â§ 80th percentile
   - Separate model weights per regime

2. **Feature Stability Monitoring**
   - Track top 10 feature importance shifts
   - Alert on >20% importance changes
   - Preemptive data quality detection

### Expected Combined Impact
- **Current MAPE:** 2.16%
- **Target MAPE:** 1.8-2.0%
- **Implementation:** <1 week
- **Complexity:** Low (operational improvements only)

## üîí SECURITY & VERSION CONTROL

### Model Integrity
- **Hash Verification:** SHA-256 checksums for model files
- **Access Control:** Read-only production model access
- **Backup Strategy:** Automated daily model snapshots

### Change Management
- **Approval Required:** Any model changes require explicit approval
- **Testing Protocol:** All changes tested on 30-day holdout
- **Rollback Plan:** Immediate revert capability to last known good

### Documentation Requirements
- **Model Cards:** Full lineage for each production model
- **Performance Tracking:** Daily MAPE monitoring
- **Incident Response:** Escalation procedures for model failures

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS

1. **Never use V5 models in production** - Performance degraded
2. **Always verify model ID exactly** - Similar names exist
3. **62 features required** - Other feature counts indicate wrong model
4. **Oct 23, 2025 creation date** - Earlier dates are deprecated models

**When in doubt, refer to this registry. No exceptions.**
