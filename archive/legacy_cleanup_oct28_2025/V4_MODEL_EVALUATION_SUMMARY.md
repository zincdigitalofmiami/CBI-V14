## 🔬 DETAILED ANALYSIS

### V4 Enriched Models (SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE)

**Status:** ✅ Trained Oct 23, 2025 @ 15:35-15:47 UTC  
**Dataset:** Enhanced with additional features  
**Performance:** **Consistently beats V3 across all horizons**

**Key Metrics:**
- Lowest MAE across all horizons (1.55-1.81 range)
- Highest R² scores (0.940-0.963)
- Most consistent MAPE (~3-3.6%)
- **1-Month model achieves lowest error (MAE 1.55)**

**Comparison to V3:**
- **1w:** 4.1% improvement (1.65 vs 1.72 MAE)
- **1m:** 44.8% improvement (1.55 vs 2.81 MAE) 🎯
- **3m:** 50.9% improvement (1.81 vs 3.69 MAE) 🎯
- **6m:** 56.9% improvement (1.76 vs 4.08 MAE) 🎯

### V3 Boosted Tree Models (Baseline)

**Status:** ✅ Production-ready (trained Oct 22, 2025)  
**Performance:** Good for 1-week, degrading for longer horizons

**Key Metrics:**
- Strong 1-week performance (MAE 1.72, R² 0.956)
- Performance degrades significantly for 3m/6m horizons
- Best short-term forecasting model
- Reliable baseline for production

### V4 DNN Models (Disappointing)

**Status:** ✅ Trained Oct 23, 2025  
**Performance:** ❌ Worse than V3 baseline

**Key Metrics:**
- High MAE (5.27-6.01 range)
- Low R² scores (0.526-0.655)
- MAPE > 10% (double digit errors)
- Not recommended for production

**Analysis:** DNN models may need:
- More training data
- Different architecture
- Better feature engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning

### ARIMA Models (Time Series Baseline)

**Status:** ✅ Trained Oct 23, 2025  
**Performance:** ✅ Successfully trained with seasonality detection

**Key Metrics:**
- All models detected yearly seasonality
- Holiday effects detected
- Spike/dip detection working
- Proper non-seasonal parameters (p, d, q)

**Model Parameters:**
- **1w:** ARIMA(1,1,0) with YEARLY seasonality
- **1m:** ARIMA(2,1,0) with WEEKLY + YEARLY seasonality
- **3m:** ARIMA(1,1,0) with YEARLY seasonality
- **6m:** ARIMA(0,1,2) with NO seasonality

**Use Case:** Time series baseline for comparison with ML models

## 🎯 PERFORMANCE AGAINST TARGETS

**Target:** MAPE < 2.0% for institutional-grade forecasting

**Current Status:**
- ❌ No models meet 2% MAPE target
- ✅ V4 Enriched models closest (3.09-3.62%)
- ⚠️ Need ensemble or AutoML to reach target

**Closest to Target:**
1. V4 Enriched 1m: 3.09% (1.09% away from target)
2. V4 Enriched 1w: 3.30% (1.30% away from target)
3. V4 Enriched 6m: 3.53% (1.53% away from target)

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:

1. **✅ PROMOTE V4 ENRICHED MODELS TO PRODUCTION**
   - These are clearly superior to V3 baseline
   - Replace V3 models in production API
   - Use as default forecasting models

2. **⏳ WAIT FOR AUTOML TRAINING**
   - 4 AutoML models currently training (~3-4 hours remaining)
   - May achieve sub-2% MAPE target
   - Evaluate when complete

3. **🔬 INVESTIGATE DNN FAILURE**
   - Why are DNN models performing so poorly?
   - Check data preprocessing
   - Review architecture
   - Consider dropping DNN track if AutoML works better

4. **📊 CREATE ENSEMBLE MODEL**
   - Combine V4 Enriched + ARIMA predictions
   - May improve accuracy further
   - Test weighted averaging

### Production Deployment Plan:

**Phase 1 (NOW):**
- Deploy V4 Enriched models as default
- Keep V3 as fallback
- Monitor production performance

**Phase 2 (After AutoML completes):**
- Evaluate AutoML performance
- If AutoML achieves <2% MAPE, replace V4 Enriched
- If not, keep V4 Enriched as primary

**Phase 3 (Ensemble):**
- Build ensemble combining best models
- May push us under 2% MAPE target
- Deploy as premium forecasting option

## 📈 COST ANALYSIS

**Training Costs (Session):**
- V4 Enriched: ~$0.05
- V4 DNN: ~$0.05
- V4 ARIMA: ~$0.10
- **Total:** ~$0.20

**AutoML Training (In Progress):**
- Estimated: $0.50-1.00 (4 models × 1-1.5h each)
- Expected completion: ~19:30 UTC

**Total Project Investment:** ~$0.70-1.20 for complete V4 suite

## ✅ CONCLUSIONS

1. **V4 Enriched models are production-ready and superior to V3**
2. **1-Month forecasting is most accurate (MAE 1.55)**
3. **Performance degrades with longer horizons (expected)**
4. **DNN models need investigation - performing poorly**
5. **ARIMA models provide good time series baseline**
6. **AutoML may push us under 2% MAPE target**

**Recommendation:** Deploy V4 Enriched models immediately as production default.

**Next Steps:**
1. Wire V4 Enriched models to API
2. Update dashboard to use new models
3. Monitor AutoML training progress
4. Evaluate AutoML when complete
5. Build ensemble if needed for <2% MAPE
