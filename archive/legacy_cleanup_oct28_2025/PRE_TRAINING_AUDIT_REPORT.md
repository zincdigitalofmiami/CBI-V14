## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Dataset Status: ‚úÖ READY FOR TRAINING WITH MINOR REMEDIATION

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ Zero duplicate rows (perfect 1:1 date ratio)
- ‚úÖ All Big 8 signals present with 100% data coverage
- ‚úÖ Complete target coverage for 1W horizon
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial target coverage for longer horizons (1M: 1.8% null, 3M: 6.6% null, 6M: 13.8% null)
- ‚ùå One critical NULL-only column: `econ_gdp_growth` (100% null)
- ‚úÖ Date range: 2020-10-21 to 2025-10-13 (5 years of data)

**Recommendation:** Proceed with training after excluding NULL-only columns and filtering incomplete horizons appropriately.

## 1. DATASET INVENTORY

### Row-Level Quality
```
Total Rows:        1,251
Unique Dates:      1,251
Duplicate Rows:    0 ‚úÖ PERFECT
Date Range:        2020-10-21 to 2025-10-13
Coverage:          5.0 years of daily data
```

### Target Variable Coverage
| Horizon | Total | Nulls | Null % | Status |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1W      | 1,251 | 0      | 0.0%   | ‚úÖ COMPLETE |
| 1M      | 1,251 | 23     | 1.8%   | ‚úÖ NEARLY COMPLETE |
| 3M      | 1,251 | 83     | 6.6%   | ‚ö†Ô∏è ACCEPTABLE |
| 6M      | 1,251 | 173    | 13.8%  | ‚ö†Ô∏è ACCEPTABLE |

**Analysis:** NULL targets at longer horizons are expected due to:
- Insufficient historical data for earliest dates (t+180 days from 2020-10-21 = April 2021)
- Data availability constraints at dataset tail

**Training Impact:** 
- All horizons can be trained with `WHERE target_{horizon} IS NOT NULL` filter
- Data loss is minimal and acceptable

| Signal | Column Name | Null Coverage | Status |
|--------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| VIX Stress | `feature_vix_stress` | 0 / 1,251 (0%) | ‚úÖ COMPLETE |
| Harvest Pace | `feature_harvest_pace` | 0 / 1,251 (0%) | ‚úÖ COMPLETE |
| China Relations | `feature_china_relations` | 0 / 1,251 (0%) | ‚úÖ COMPLETE |

## 3. NULL COLUMN ANALYSIS

### Critical Finding: econ_gdp_growth

**Status:** ‚ùå 100% NULL (1,251 / 1,251 rows)

**Impact:** 
- Will cause BigQuery ML training failures
- Column cannot be normalized (no non-null values)
- Must be excluded from training

**Remediation Strategy:**
```sql
-- Exclude econ_gdp_growth from training
SELECT * EXCEPT(econ_gdp_growth)
FROM training_dataset_super_enriched
```

### Other Columns Requiring Investigation

Based on INFORMATION_SCHEMA, all other columns are marked as nullable. However, our checks showed:
- ‚úÖ All Big 8 signals: 0% null
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unknown null rates for other feature columns
- üìä Need to scan remaining columns systematically

**Recommended Script:** `fix_null_columns_and_train.py` will:
1. Check each column for null percentage
2. Exclude columns with 100% null coverage
3. Create cleaned dataset
4. Train baseline models

## 5. TEMPORAL ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT

### Current State
Based on available columns, temporal engineering appears to include:
- ‚úÖ Lag structures for prices (1d, 7d, 30d)
- ‚úÖ Multi-horizon correlations (7d, 30d, 90d, 180d, 365d)
- ‚úÖ Moving averages and momentum indicators
- ‚úÖ Seasonal decompositions

### Missing from Requirements
‚ùå **Decay Functions:** No clear exponential/linear decay features visible in schema  
‚ùå **Signal-Specific Lags:** Big 8 signals appear as single values, not multi-lag series  
‚ùå **Regime Interactions:** No explicit interaction terms between signals and VIX regimes  

**Recommendation:** 
- Validate against `market_signal_engine.py` to confirm signal calculation method
- Check if temporal engineering happens upstream (views) vs. in-training dataset
- Consider adding decay features in pre-training pipeline if not present

---

## 6. DATA SPLIT STRATEGY

### Recommended Approach: Temporal Splits

**Training:** 2020-10-21 to 2024-10-31 (4 years)  
**Validation:** 2024-11-01 to 2025-03-31 (5 months)  
**Test:** 2025-04-01 to 2025-10-13 (6 months)

**Rationale:**
- Maintains temporal order (no future data in training)
- Sufficient validation window for performance assessment
- Recent test set reflects current market conditions

### Horizon-Specific Filtering
```sql
-- Train with WHERE clauses for each horizon
WHERE target_1w IS NOT NULL  -- Full 1,251 rows
WHERE target_1m IS NOT NULL  -- ~1,228 rows
WHERE target_3m IS NOT NULL  -- ~1,168 rows
WHERE target_6m IS NOT NULL  -- ~1,078 rows
```

---

## 7. MODEL TRAINING PLAN

### Baseline Configuration
```sql
Model Type: BOOSTED_TREE_REGRESSOR
Horizons: 1W, 1M, 3M, 6M
Hyperparameters:
  - max_iterations: 50
  - early_stop: TRUE
  - min_rel_progress: 0.01
  - learn_rate: 0.1
  - subsample: 0.8
  - max_tree_depth: 8
  - data_split_method: RANDOM
  - data_split_eval_fraction: 0.2
```

### Expected Training Time
- Per model: ~2-5 minutes
- Total: ~10-20 minutes for 4 models
- Cost: ~$0.20-$0.50 (based on previous training runs)

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ MAE < 3.0 (institutional-grade: <3% error)
- ‚úÖ R¬≤ > 0.85 (good explanatory power)
- ‚úÖ Estimated MAPE < 5% (assuming ~$50 avg price)
- ‚úÖ No training errors

## 8. VALIDATION GUARDRAILS

### Forecast Validator Integration
**File:** `forecast/forecast_validator.py`

**Capabilities:**
- ‚úÖ Z-score threshold checks (3œÉ warning, 4œÉ auto-correction)
- ‚úÖ Historical distribution validation
- ‚úÖ Price range plausibility checks
- ‚úÖ Cross-horizon consistency validation

**Post-Training Validation:**
1. Run `ForecastValidator.validate_forecast()` on test set predictions
2. Check for extreme anomalies (>4œÉ deviations)
3. Verify horizon consistency (3M forecast between 1M and 6M)
4. Report validation results in summary

---

## 9. RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

### Risk: NULL Columns Block Training
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Likelihood:** CERTAIN (econ_gdp_growth confirmed 100% null)  
**Mitigation:** 
- ‚úÖ Exclude NULL-only columns in pre-processing
- ‚úÖ Use `fix_null_columns_and_train.py` for automated cleanup

### Risk: Temporal Engineering Missing
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Likelihood:** UNKNOWN  
**Mitigation:**
- Review `market_signal_engine.py` to confirm signal implementation
- Validate decay functions exist upstream or need addition
- Check signal calculation methods

### Risk: Longer Horizons Underperform
**Severity:** LOW  
**Likelihood:** LIKELY (fewer training samples)  
**Mitigation:**
- Expected due to reduced data availability
- Baseline acceptable for comparison
- Consider ensemble approaches for longer horizons

### Risk: Overfitting on Strong Performance
**Severity:** LOW  
**Likelihood:** LOW  
**Mitigation:**
- Built-in early stopping (min_rel_progress: 0.01)
- Data split method prevents overfitting
- Cross-validation on held-out set
