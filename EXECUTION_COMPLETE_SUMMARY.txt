EXECUTION SUMMARY - November 15, 2025
=====================================

WHAT WAS DONE:
-------------
✅ Phase 0: Created missing dependencies (historical view, risk-free rates)
✅ Phase 1: Cleaned duplicates, populated regimes (3 active: covid/inflation/trump)
✅ Phase 2: Exported ALL 10 Parquet files for training
✅ Phase 3: Created MAPE view (working) and tracking tables
✅ Phase 4B: Added dashboard integration specs to plan

CRITICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
---------------------
1. TRAINING READY: All 10 Parquet files exported with regimes/weights
2. PERFORMANCE TRACKING: MAPE metrics working at 4.0%
3. DASHBOARD SPECS: Complete integration plan with position sizing
4. CLEAN ARCHITECTURE: Duplicates removed, naming standardized

WHAT WORKS NOW:
--------------
• Local M4 training can proceed immediately
• MAPE performance tracking is live
• Regime weights are applied (800-5000)
• Dashboard can display core metrics
• Historical tracking tables ready

REMAINING GAPS:
--------------
• Sharpe view has minor SQL fix needed (subquery issue)
• Historical data only 2020-2025 (needs 2000-2020 backfill)
• API view needs final integration
• Only 3 of 9 regimes present due to limited date range

KEY NUMBERS:
-----------
Tables cleaned: 5 duplicates removed
Parquet exported: 10/10 files
Regimes active: 3 (covid, inflation, trump)
Weight range: 800-5000
Date coverage: 2020-2025 (5 years)
MAPE accuracy: 4.0%
Completion: 75%

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
------------------------
1. Fix Sharpe subquery (5 min)
2. Update API view (10 min)
3. Historical backfill for 2000-2020 (30 min)

BOTTOM LINE:
-----------
System is OPERATIONAL for training and basic dashboard.
Full historical analysis requires backfill.
Dashboard integration plan complete and ready.

Time invested: ~45 minutes
Time to 100%: ~45 minutes remaining
