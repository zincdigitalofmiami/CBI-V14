🚀 CBI-V14 BigQuery Schema Deployment
==========================================
Project: cbi-v14
Location: us-central1
Mode: DRY RUN (no changes will be made)

📁 Step 1: Creating BigQuery Datasets...
  Processing dataset: market_data
    [DRY RUN] Would create dataset market_data
  Processing dataset: raw_intelligence
    [DRY RUN] Would create dataset raw_intelligence
  Processing dataset: signals
    ✓ Dataset signals already exists (skipping)
  Processing dataset: features
    ✓ Dataset features already exists (skipping)
  Processing dataset: training
    [DRY RUN] Would create dataset training
  Processing dataset: regimes
    [DRY RUN] Would create dataset regimes
  Processing dataset: drivers
    [DRY RUN] Would create dataset drivers
  Processing dataset: neural
    [DRY RUN] Would create dataset neural
  Processing dataset: predictions
    ✓ Dataset predictions already exists (skipping)
  Processing dataset: monitoring
    [DRY RUN] Would create dataset monitoring
  Processing dataset: dim
    [DRY RUN] Would create dataset dim
  Processing dataset: ops
    [DRY RUN] Would create dataset ops

✅ All datasets created/verified

📊 Step 2: Creating Tables from Schema...
  Parsing and executing DDL statements...

✅ Table creation complete

🏷️ Step 3: Applying Dataset Labels...
  [DRY RUN] Would execute scripts/deployment/apply_bq_labels.sh to apply labels

🔍 Step 4: Validating Schema...
  Table counts by dataset:
    market_data: 4 tables
    raw_intelligence: 7 tables
    signals: 1 tables
    features: 4 tables
    training: 18 tables
    regimes: 0 tables
    drivers: 0 tables
    neural: 0 tables
    predictions: 4 tables
    monitoring: 1 tables
    dim: 0 tables
    ops: 0 tables

  Verifying critical tables:
    ✓ training.regime_calendar exists
    ✓ training.regime_weights exists
    ✓ training.zl_training_prod_allhistory_1w exists
    ❌ training.mes_training_prod_allhistory_1min missing!
    ❌ features.master_features missing!
    ❌ signals.hidden_relationship_signals missing!
    ❌ raw_intelligence.news_intelligence missing!
    ❌ ops.ingestion_runs missing!
    ❌ monitoring.model_performance missing!

  Checking master_features columns:
./scripts/deployment/deploy_bq_schema.sh: line 213: [: +-----------+: integer expression expected
    ⚠️  master_features has only +-----------+ columns (expected 400+)

==========================================
✅ BigQuery Schema Deployment Complete!

Next Steps:
1. Run historical data backfill:
   - Yahoo ZL 2000-2010
   - DataBento 2010-present
   - FRED/USDA/EIA/CFTC historical

2. Populate regime tables:
   - Load regime_calendar (11 regimes, 2000-2025)
   - Load regime_weights (50-5000 scale)

3. Build master_features:
   - Run feature engineering pipeline
   - Populate all 400+ columns

4. Create training exports:
   - ZL: 5 horizons (1w, 1m, 3m, 6m, 12m)
   - MES: 12 horizons (1min-12m)
