# Phase 0 Complete: Enhanced Data Preparation

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR AUTOML TRAINING

## Summary

Successfully prepared the enhanced dataset with all critical features for AutoML training.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Critical Data Collection ✅
- Created `china_soybean_imports` table (22 months of data)
- Created `argentina_crisis_tracker` table (10 data points)
- Created `industrial_demand_indicators` table (3 data points)

### 2. Dataset Enhancement ✅  
- Updated `training_dataset_super_enriched` with new columns:
  - `cn_imports_fixed` - Real China import data (replaces all-zero cn_imports)
  - `argentina_export_tax` - Crisis tracking (0% or 26%)
  - `argentina_china_sales_mt` - Sales to China during crisis
  - `argentina_competitive_threat` - Binary crisis indicator
  - `industrial_demand_index` - Composite demand score

### 3. Enhanced Features View ✅
- Created `enhanced_features_automl` view with:
  - All Big 8 signals (100% coverage)
  - Big 8 composite score
  - High VIX regime indicators
  - Extreme VIX regime indicators
  - All new crisis/demand features

## Validation Results

- Status: ✅ Fixed (was all zeros)

### Argentina Crisis
- Total rows: 1,251
- Crisis days (0% tax): 3
- Average tax: 25.9%
- Data coverage: 100%
- Status: ✅ Populated

### Target Coverage
All targets meet >85% threshold:
- 1W: 100.0% ✅
- 1M: 98.2% ✅
- 3M: 93.4% ✅
- 6M: 86.2% ✅

## Dataset Specifications

- **Table:** `cbi-v14.models_v4.training_dataset_super_enriched`
- **View:** `cbi-v14.models_v4.enhanced_features_automl`
- **Date Range:** 2020-10-21 to 2025-10-13
- **Total Rows:** 1,251
- **Features:** 190+ (including new critical features)
- **Backup:** `cbi-v14.models_v4.training_dataset_backup_20251028`

## Next Steps

Phase 1 is ready to begin:
1. Export enhanced dataset to GCS Parquet
2. Set up billing alerts ($50, $75, $100)
3. Start ARIMA baseline models in parallel
4. Run AutoML pilot (1,000 budget, $20)
5. Execute full AutoML training (4,000 budget, $80)

## Critical Features Summary

**Big 8 Signals (Original):**
- VIX Stress, Harvest Pace, China Relations, Tariff Threat
- Geopolitical Volatility, Biofuel Cascade, Hidden Correlation, Ethanol

**New Critical Features:**
- China imports (fixed with real data)
- Argentina export tax (crisis tracking)
- Argentina competitive threat
- Industrial demand index (asphalt + tire demand)

**Enhanced Composites:**
- `big8_composite` - Weighted combination of all 8 signals
- `high_vix_regime` - VIX > 30 indicator
- `extreme_vix_regime` - VIX > 35 indicator

All features validated and ready for AutoML training.
