# STATUS SUMMARY - October 29, 2025

## REALITY CHECK

### Batch Predictions Status:
- ❌ ALL batch jobs FAILED
- ❌ Even the "successful" job only created an errors table
- ❌ Quota limit: Can only run 1 batch job at a time
- ❌ Schema mismatch: Model expects different columns than we're providing

### What We Know:
1. ✅ 4 Vertex AI AutoML models exist and are trained
2. ✅ Training data exists (1,263 rows)
3. ✅ Input table exists (batch_prediction_input)
4. ❌ Models reject our input (schema mismatch or missing `date` column issue)
5. ❌ Quota prevents running multiple jobs in parallel

### The Core Problem:
**The models were trained on a DIFFERENT schema than what we're feeding them for predictions.**

### Next Step:
Check what schema the models were ACTUALLY trained on, then match our input exactly to that.
