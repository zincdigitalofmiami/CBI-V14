## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 1. Dynamic Weighting System
```python
# Weight calculation formula
weight = exp(1 / max(recent_mape, 0.1))
normalized_weight = weight / sum(all_weights)

# Update frequency: Daily
# Lookback window: 30 days
# Minimum MAPE threshold: 0.1% (prevents division by zero)
```

### 2. Statistical Validation Layer
```python
# Z-score validation
z_score = abs(prediction - historical_mean) / historical_std
if z_score > 3.0:
    adjusted_prediction = historical_mean + 0.5 * (prediction - historical_mean)

# Physical constraints
min_price, max_price = 20.0, 120.0
bounded_prediction = np.clip(prediction, min_price, max_price)
```

### 3. Regime Detection
```python
# Simple VIX-based regime detection
recent_vix = data['vix_current'].tail(30).mean()
vix_threshold = data['vix_current'].quantile(0.8)
regime = 'high_vol' if recent_vix > vix_threshold else 'low_vol'

# Regime-specific weights
regime_weights = {
    'low_vol': {'1w': 0.3, '1m': 0.3, '3m': 0.2, '6m': 0.2},
    'high_vol': {'1w': 0.4, '1m': 0.2, '3m': 0.2, '6m': 0.2}
}
```

### 4. Feature Stability Monitoring
```python
# Track importance changes in top 10 features
importance_change = abs(current_importance - previous_importance) / previous_importance
if importance_change > 0.20:  # 20% threshold
    trigger_alert("Feature importance shift detected")
```

## ðŸ“Š MONITORING & ALERTING CONFIGURATION

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "MAPE Degradation"
    condition: "daily_mape > baseline_mape + 0.5% for 3 consecutive days"
    action: "Page on-call engineer"
    
  - name: "Feature Importance Shift"
    condition: "top_10_feature_importance_change > 20%"
    action: "Investigate data quality"
    
  - name: "Extreme Predictions"
    condition: "prediction_z_score > 3.0 for >10% of daily predictions"

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Staging Deployment (Days 1-5)
1. Deploy enhanced ensemble to staging environment
2. Run parallel predictions alongside V4 baseline
3. Validate performance improvements on historical data
4. Test all alerting and monitoring systems

### Phase 2: Canary Deployment (Day 6)
1. Route 10% of production traffic to enhanced ensemble
2. Monitor performance metrics in real-time
3. Compare predictions with V4 baseline
4. Validate no degradation in edge cases

### Phase 3: Full Production (Day 7)
1. Route 100% of traffic to enhanced ensemble
2. Keep V4 models as immediate rollback option
3. Monitor for 48 hours with enhanced alerting
4. Document final performance improvements

### Rollback Plan
- **Trigger:** Any critical alert or MAPE degradation >0.3%
- **Action:** Immediate revert to V4 baseline models
- **Timeline:** <5 minutes rollback capability
- **Validation:** Confirm rollback successful within 15 minutes
