# V4 ENHANCED MODEL TRAINING STATUS
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Time:** 18:20 UTC

## ✅ PRE-TRAINING AUDIT COMPLETE

### Workspace Cleaned
- **Removed:** 37 duplicate/legacy CSV files → archived
- **Removed:** 39 legacy markdown status files → archived  
- **Removed:** 23 intermediate Python task scripts → archived
- **Kept:** V4_EXACT_DATASET.csv (primary training data)
- **Kept:** 15 essential Python scripts for training & operations

### Data Status

#### ✅ READY
- **Soybean Oil Prices:** Fresh (0 days old) - 1,271 rows
- **V4 Training Dataset:** V4_EXACT_DATASET.csv - 1,251 rows, 195 features
- **Models V4 Infrastructure:** BigQuery dataset ready
- **Dashboard Tables:** 3 tables created (prediction_history, regime_history, performance_metrics)

#### ⚠️ ISSUES (Non-blocking)
- **Economic Indicators:** Has future dates (2026-07-01) - needs cleanup
- **Social Sentiment:** 7 days old - should be refreshed
- **FRED API:** Connection timeouts - economic data pulls failing
- **Dashboard Views:** 11/28 views broken (missing source tables)

### Bidaily Pulls Status
| Time | Script | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| 08:00, 18:00 | fresh_data_emergency_pull.py | ⚠️ FRED timeout, Yahoo working |
| 10:00, 16:00 | social_intelligence.py | ✅ Configured |
| Every 6h | gdelt_china_intelligence.py | ✅ Configured |
| Every 4h | trump_truth_social_monitor.py | ✅ Configured |
| 06:00 | ingest_weather_noaa.py | ✅ Configured |
| 07:00 | ingest_brazil_weather_inmet.py | ✅ Configured |

### Four Horizons Configuration
| Horizon | Model | Status | Expected MAPE |
|---------|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1-Week | V4 Enriched Boosted Tree | ✅ Ready | ~3.30% |
| 1-Month | V4 Enriched Boosted Tree | ✅ Ready | ~3.09% (Best) |
| 3-Month | V4 Enriched Boosted Tree | ✅ Ready | ~3.62% |
| 6-Month | V4 Enriched Boosted Tree | ✅ Ready | ~3.53% |

## 🚀 READY TO TRAIN V4 ENHANCED MODEL

### Training Command
```bash
cd /Users/zincdigital/CBI-V14
python3 train_bigquery_ml_enhanced.py
```

### Post-Training Steps
1. Run `prediction_metadata_extractor.py` to generate predictions
2. Run `dashboard_data_pipeline.py` to populate dashboard tables
3. Test enhanced dashboard views
4. Deploy to production API

### Known Limitations
- Economic indicators may be stale due to FRED API issues
- Some enrichment features may be missing
- 11 dashboard views need repair (can be fixed post-training)

### Safeguards in Place
✅ Error handling in all ingestion scripts  
✅ Retry logic for API calls  
✅ BigQuery schema validation  
✅ Logging to track issues  
⚠️ No automated rollback (manual intervention required)  
⚠️ No alerting on failures (check logs manually)
