# COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP PLAN - CBI-V14 Models Dataset
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Execution  
**Risk Level:** LOW (all items verified safe to delete)

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After comprehensive audit, identified **6 objects for deletion** with **zero production impact**:
- 1 test model (created by audit script today)
- 2 static forecast tables (superseded by actual models)
- 3 old training tables (superseded by current views)

**Storage to reclaim:** ~0.06 MB (minimal but improves hygiene)  
**Objects remaining:** 31 tables/views + 26 production models  

---

## ‚úÖ AUDIT FINDINGS

### Current State:
- **Total objects**: 37 tables/views
- **BQML models**: 27 trained models
- **Storage**: 0.25 MB total
- **Orphaned tables**: 8 (not referenced by views)
- **Test artifacts**: 1 (created today)

### Quality Assessment:
‚úÖ **No duplicate views** - all views are unique  
‚úÖ **No versioning conflicts** - versioning is in model names, not tables  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Some old training data** - superseded by current views  
‚ö†Ô∏è **One test model** - left over from compatibility testing  

---

## üóëÔ∏è OBJECTS TO DELETE

### 1. TEST ARTIFACTS (HIGH PRIORITY - DELETE IMMEDIATELY)

#### `linear_reg_test_compatibility` (MODEL)
- **Type**: BQML LINEAR_REGRESSION model
- **Created**: October 22, 2025 at 13:05 (today)
- **Purpose**: Compatibility testing during audit
- **Usage**: NONE - test artifact
- **Why Delete**: Created by audit script to test BQML compatibility
- **Impact**: ZERO
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  bq rm -m cbi-v14:models.linear_reg_test_compatibility
  ```

### 2. STATIC FORECAST TABLES (MEDIUM PRIORITY - DELETE)

These are **static forecast outputs**, NOT models. Real forecasting uses the actual BQML models.

#### `zl_forecast_arima_plus_v1` (TABLE)
- **Type**: Static forecast data
- **Rows**: 30
- **Created**: October 11, 2025
- **Schema**: [forecast_date, predicted_price, lower_bound, upper_bound, confidence_level]
- **Why Delete**: Static snapshot superseded by actual BQML model `bqml_arima_plus_zl_v1`
- **Impact**: ZERO - forecasts regenerated from actual model
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  bq rm -t cbi-v14:models.zl_forecast_arima_plus_v1
  ```

#### `zl_forecast_baseline_v1` (TABLE)
- **Type**: Static forecast data
- **Rows**: 30
- **Created**: October 11, 2025
- **Schema**: [forecast_timestamp, forecast_value, standard_error, confidence_level, prediction_interval_lower_bound]
- **Why Delete**: Static snapshot superseded by actual BQML model `bqml_zl_arima_baseline_v1`
- **Impact**: ZERO - forecasts regenerated from actual model
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  bq rm -t cbi-v14:models.zl_forecast_baseline_v1
  ```

### 3. OLD TRAINING TABLES (LOW PRIORITY - DELETE)

These are **old training datasets** superseded by current views.

#### `zl_enhanced_training` (TABLE)
- **Type**: Training dataset
- **Rows**: 100 (tiny!)
- **Created**: October 14, 2025
- **Columns**: 27
- **Why Delete**: 
  - Only 100 rows (insufficient for training)
  - Superseded by `vw_neural_training_dataset` (1,251 rows)
  - Not referenced anywhere
- **Impact**: ZERO - current view has 12x more data
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  bq rm -t cbi-v14:models.zl_enhanced_training
  ```

#### `zl_price_training_base` (TABLE)
- **Type**: Training dataset
- **Rows**: 525
- **Created**: October 11, 2025
- **Columns**: 9
- **Why Delete**:
  - Only 9 columns (no ML features)
  - Superseded by `vw_neural_training_dataset` (159 columns)
  - Not referenced anywhere
- **Impact**: ZERO - current view has 17x more features
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  bq rm -t cbi-v14:models.zl_price_training_base
  ```

## ‚úÖ OBJECTS TO KEEP

### Precomputed Feature Tables (Created Today for Performance):
- ‚úÖ `price_features_precomputed` - 1,258 rows, 15 columns
- ‚úÖ `sentiment_features_precomputed` - 604 rows, 4 columns
- ‚úÖ `weather_features_precomputed` - 1,024 rows, 7 columns

**Why Keep**: Performance optimization for feature engineering

### Specialized Training Data:
- ‚úÖ `zl_timesfm_training_v1` - 100 rows, 20 columns
  - Last modified: October 14, 2025
  - Purpose: Specific format for TimeSFM model training
  - Not superseded by standard training views

### All Views (29 views):
- ‚úÖ All views are current and properly structured
- ‚úÖ No duplicate views found
- ‚úÖ All follow naming conventions

### Production Models (26 models after cleanup):
- ‚úÖ 15 ARIMA models (various horizons and versions)
- ‚úÖ 5 DNN models (neural networks)
- ‚úÖ 4 Boosted Tree models (LightGBM)
- ‚úÖ 2 Linear Regression models

## üìã EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Delete Test Artifacts (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
# Delete test model from audit
bq rm -m -f cbi-v14:models.linear_reg_test_compatibility
```

### Phase 2: Delete Static Forecast Tables (SAFE)
```bash
# Delete old static forecasts
bq rm -t -f cbi-v14:models.zl_forecast_arima_plus_v1
bq rm -t -f cbi-v14:models.zl_forecast_baseline_v1
```

### Phase 3: Delete Old Training Tables (SAFE)
```bash
# Delete superseded training data
bq rm -t -f cbi-v14:models.zl_enhanced_training
bq rm -t -f cbi-v14:models.zl_price_training_base
```

### Verification After Cleanup:
```bash
# List remaining objects
bq ls cbi-v14:models
bq ls --models cbi-v14:models
```

---

## ‚úÖ SAFETY VERIFICATION

### Pre-Deletion Checklist:

- [x] Verified no code references to deleted objects
- [x] Confirmed all tables/models have newer replacements
- [x] Validated that forecast data is regenerable from models
- [x] Checked that training data is superseded by current views
- [x] Ensured precomputed tables are recent and in use

### Post-Deletion Validation:

```python
# Run after cleanup
python3 scripts/catalog_models_dataset.py
```

Expected result:
- Total objects: 31 (down from 37)
- Orphaned tables: 4 (down from 8)
- Storage: ~0.19 MB (down from 0.25 MB)

---

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Before Cleanup:
- 37 tables/views
- 27 models (1 test model)
- 8 orphaned tables
- 0.25 MB storage

### After Cleanup:
- 31 tables/views ‚úÖ
- 26 models (all production) ‚úÖ
- 4 orphaned tables (all precomputed/specialized) ‚úÖ
- 0.19 MB storage ‚úÖ

### Benefits:
1. ‚úÖ Cleaner dataset with no test artifacts
2. ‚úÖ No confusion from duplicate static forecasts
3. ‚úÖ Reduced mental overhead
4. ‚úÖ Clear separation of current vs old training data
5. ‚úÖ Improved documentation accuracy

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS AFTER CLEANUP

1. **Complete ML Pipeline Audit** on `vw_neural_training_dataset`
2. **Fix correlated subquery issue** to enable BQML training
3. **Evaluate model performance** across all versions
4. **Delete underperforming model versions** (Phase 2 cleanup)
5. **Document which models are in production**
