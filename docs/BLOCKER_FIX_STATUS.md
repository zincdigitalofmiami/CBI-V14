# CBI-V14 Blocker Fix Status Report
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Session:** Critical Blocker Resolution  
**Status:** PARTIAL FIXES COMPLETE

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### ✅ FIXED (Operational)
- **ScrapeCreators API**: Endpoint corrected, API fully operational (5,003 credits remaining)
- **SSL Certificates**: Upgraded certifi to 2025.10.5

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY BLOCKED (Workarounds Available)
- **RSS Feeds**: SSL certificate errors + incorrect/404 URLs, requires alternative scraping

### ❌ SYNTHETIC DATA (Requires Replacement)
- **CFTC COT Reports**: 52 rows synthetic placeholder data
- **USDA Export Sales**: 17 rows synthetic placeholder data  
- **Biofuel Production**: 24 rows fallback/synthetic data
- **Biofuel Policy**: 6 rows fallback data (minimal but functional)

---

## DETAILED FIX STATUS

### 1. ScrapeCreators API ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Original script used wrong endpoint `/v1/twitter/user/posts` with parameter `username`
- All requests returned 404 errors

**Root Cause:**
- ScrapeCreators API uses `/v1/twitter/user-tweets` endpoint with parameter `handle`

**Solution:**
- Created `ingest_scrapecreators_institutional_FIXED.py`
- Changed endpoint to: `https://api.scrapecreators.com/v1/twitter/user-tweets`
- Changed parameter from `username` to `handle`
- Increased timeout to 45s (API can be slow)
- Added rate limiting (3s between requests)

**Test Results:**
```
✅ API Response: 200 OK
✅ Credits Remaining: 5,003
✅ Test Query (@ASA_Soybeans): Retrieved 100 tweets successfully
✅ Authentication: Working
✅ Rate Limiting: No 429 errors
```

**Current State:**
- API is 100% operational
- Script successfully fetches tweets
- Keyword filtering working (0 relevant posts is expected when tweets don't mention soy/china/policy)
- Ready for production use

**Tables Created:**
- `staging.institutional_lobbying_intel` (schema ready)
- `staging.congressional_agriculture_intel` (schema ready)
- `staging.financial_analyst_intel` (schema ready)
- `staging.china_state_media_intel` (schema ready)

**Action Required:**
- Run full collection with all 15 handles (will take 5-10 minutes)
- Consider loosening keyword filters if relevance rate stays at 0%

### 2. RSS Feed Ingestion ⚠️ PARTIALLY BLOCKED

**Problem:**
- All RSS feeds return SSL certificate verification errors
- Treasury RSS URL returns 404 (incorrect/outdated URL)

**Root Cause:**
- macOS Python SSL certificate chain incomplete
- `/Applications/Python 3.12/Install Certificates.command` not found in standard location
- RSS feed URLs may have changed

**Attempted Fixes:**
1. ✅ Upgraded certifi to 2025.10.5
2. ❌ Treasury URL still returns 404 even with `verify=False`
3. ⚠️ SSL cert issue persists for urllib (used by feedparser)

**Test Results:**
```
Treasury (https://home.treasury.gov/rss):
  ❌ SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED
  ❌ With verify=False: 404 Not Found
  
USTR (https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/feed):
  ❌ SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED
  ❌ Status: Unknown (SSL blocks request)
  
ICE (https://www.ice.gov/feeds/news.rss):
  ❌ SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED
  ❌ Status: Unknown (SSL blocks request)
```

**Alternative Solution Required:**
1. **Option A**: Install Python certificates manually
   ```bash
   cd /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/
   ./bin/pip3 install --upgrade certifi
   # Run certificate install script if it exists
   ```

2. **Option B**: Scrape press release pages directly (bypass RSS)
   - Treasury: Scrape https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases
   - USTR: Scrape https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases  
   - ICE: Scrape https://www.ice.gov/news/releases

3. **Option C**: Use requests with `verify=False` + warning suppression (not recommended for production)

**Recommendation:**
- Proceed with **Option B** (direct HTML scraping of press release pages)
- More reliable than RSS feeds
- Can extract date, title, summary, link directly from HTML
- Respects hard stop rule (don't proceed until data path is verified)

### 3. Synthetic Data in Staging Tables ❌ REQUIRES REPLACEMENT

**Current Synthetic Data Inventory:**

#### 3A. CFTC COT Reports (`staging.cftc_cot`)
- **Rows:** 52
- **Type:** Synthetic placeholder
- **Created:** Previous session with fallback data generator
- **Data Quality:** Plausible but not real
- **Sample:**
  ```
  2025-10-21 | Soybean_Oil | 19,355 long | -12,385 commercial
  2025-10-14 | Soybean_Oil | 26,580 long | -18,981 commercial
  ```
- **Required Action:** 
  - Build real CFTC scraper using https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm
  - Or use alternative: https://www.quandl.com/data/CFTC (if API available)
  - Delete synthetic rows before production

#### 3B. USDA Export Sales (`staging.usda_export_sales`)
- **Rows:** 17
- **Type:** Synthetic placeholder
- **Created:** Previous session with fallback data generator
- **Data Quality:** Placeholder values
- **Required Action:**
  - Fix USDA FAS scraper (PDFs or HTML tables)
  - Alternative: UN Comtrade API for China/Brazil exports
  - Delete synthetic rows before production

#### 3C. Biofuel Production (`staging.biofuel_production`)
- **Rows:** 24
- **Type:** Synthetic/fallback
- **Created:** EIA API returned 500 errors
- **Required Action:**
  - Use FRED biodiesel production series as replacement
  - Series: `BIOPRODENERGY` or similar
  - Delete synthetic rows before production

#### 3D. Biofuel Policy (`staging.biofuel_policy`)
- **Rows:** 6
- **Type:** Known EPA mandate values (semi-real fallback)
- **Data Quality:** Accurate but minimal
- **Required Action:**
  - Scrape EPA RFS page: https://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program
  - Extract historical RVO tables
  - Current 6 rows are usable as minimal baseline

## PORT CONFLICTS ⚠️ OPERATIONAL ISSUE

**Problem:**
- Multiple dev servers running simultaneously
- Port 5173 occupied → Vite started on 5174
- Port 8080 occupied → FastAPI failed to start

**Current State:**
```
✅ Vite Dashboard: http://localhost:5174 (running)
❌ FastAPI Backend: Port 8080 in use (another process)
```

**Required Action:**
1. Kill existing processes:
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
   lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
   ```
2. Restart services on standard ports
3. Document startup/shutdown procedures

## NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### IMMEDIATE (Before Phase 3)

1. **Replace RSS feeds with HTML scraping** (2-3 hours)
   - Create `ingest_press_releases_treasury.py`
   - Create `ingest_press_releases_ustr.py`  
   - Create `ingest_press_releases_ice.py`
   - Load to staging tables, create signal views

2. **Purge synthetic data** (30 min)
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM `cbi-v14.staging.cftc_cot` WHERE source_name LIKE '%synthetic%';
   DELETE FROM `cbi-v14.staging.usda_export_sales` WHERE source_name LIKE '%synthetic%';
   DELETE FROM `cbi-v14.staging.biofuel_production` WHERE source_name LIKE '%synthetic%';
   ```

3. **Run ScrapeCreators full collection** (10 min)
   - Execute `ingest_scrapecreators_institutional_FIXED.py` with all 15 handles
   - Expected: 20-40 relevant intelligence signals

4. **Fix port conflicts** (5 min)
   - Kill rogue processes
   - Restart on standard ports

5. **Validate all views query successfully** (15 min)
   - Test all Phase 2 signal aggregate views
   - Confirm no placeholder/null data in outputs

### DEFERRED (After Phase 3 approval)

- Build real CFTC scraper
- Build real USDA export sales scraper
- Implement FRED biofuel data ingestion
- Expand EPA RFS policy scraping

---

## HARD STOP COMPLIANCE

✅ **Following Hard Stop Rule:**
- Documented all blockers before proceeding
- Did not advance to Phase 3 (model training)
- Created fix scripts but awaiting validation
- All synthetic data flagged for removal

✅ **Following Research-First Rule:**
- Searched for SSL certificate solutions
- Researched correct ScrapeCreators API endpoints (found in docs)
- Identified alternative data sources (HTML scraping vs RSS)

---

## FILES CREATED/MODIFIED

**New Files:**
- `cbi-v14-ingestion/ingest_rss_feeds_policy_FIXED.py` (SSL workarounds, but URLs still broken)
- `cbi-v14-ingestion/ingest_scrapecreators_institutional_FIXED.py` (✅ WORKING)
- `docs/BLOCKER_FIX_STATUS.md` (this file)

**Modified Files:**
- `docs/plans/CONSOLIDATED_FORWARD_PLAN.md` (added Research-First Rule)

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 3 UNTIL:**

1. ✅ ScrapeCreators full collection executed (10 min work)
2. ⚠️ RSS feeds replaced with HTML scraping OR accepted as missing (2-3 hrs work)
3. ❌ Synthetic data purged from staging tables (30 min work)
4. ✅ All signal aggregate views validated with real data (15 min work)

**Estimated Time to Clear All Blockers:** 3-4 hours

**User Approval Required:** To proceed with HTML scraping approach for press releases
