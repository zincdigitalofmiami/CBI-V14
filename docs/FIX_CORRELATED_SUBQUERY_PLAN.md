# FIX CORRELATED SUBQUERY ISSUE - EXECUTION PLAN
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è AWAITING APPROVAL - DO NOT EXECUTE YET  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (creates new tables, does NOT modify existing views)

---

## üéØ PROBLEM STATEMENT

`vw_neural_training_dataset` contains window functions (LAG, LEAD, AVG OVER, STDDEV OVER) in a CTE that is then used in LEFT JOINs. BigQuery ML interprets this as a correlated subquery and rejects it.

**Error:**
```
400 Correlated subqueries that reference other tables are not supported 
unless they can be de-correlated, such as by transforming them into an 
efficient JOIN.
```

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

Looking at the view definition, the problematic section is the `price_features` CTE (lines 21-37):

```sql
price_features AS (
    SELECT 
        date,
        zl_price_current,
        target_1w, target_1m, target_3m, target_6m,
        zl_volume,
        LAG(zl_price_current, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) as zl_price_lag1,     -- ‚Üê WINDOW
        LAG(zl_price_current, 7) OVER (ORDER BY date) as zl_price_lag7,     -- ‚Üê WINDOW
        LAG(zl_price_current, 30) OVER (ORDER BY date) as zl_price_lag30,   -- ‚Üê WINDOW
        (zl_price_current - LAG(...)) / NULLIF(...) as return_1d,            -- ‚Üê WINDOW
        (zl_price_current - LAG(...)) / NULLIF(...) as return_7d,            -- ‚Üê WINDOW
        AVG(zl_price_current) OVER (...) as ma_7d,                           -- ‚Üê WINDOW
        AVG(zl_price_current) OVER (...) as ma_30d,                          -- ‚Üê WINDOW
        STDDEV(zl_price_current) OVER (...) as volatility_30d                -- ‚Üê WINDOW
    FROM targets  -- ‚Üê targets ALSO has window functions (LEAD)
)
```

And `targets` CTE (lines 10-19) has more window functions:
```sql
targets AS (
    SELECT 
        date,
        close_price as zl_price_current,
        LEAD(close_price, 7) OVER (ORDER BY date) as target_1w,     -- ‚Üê WINDOW
        LEAD(close_price, 30) OVER (ORDER BY date) as target_1m,    -- ‚Üê WINDOW
        LEAD(close_price, 90) OVER (ORDER BY date) as target_3m,    -- ‚Üê WINDOW
        LEAD(close_price, 180) OVER (ORDER BY date) as target_6m,   -- ‚Üê WINDOW
        volume as zl_volume
    FROM daily_prices
)
```

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION APPROACH

### Strategy:
**Materialize ALL price-related window functions into a table**, then JOIN it cleanly with the other feature views.

### What Gets Materialized:
1. All window functions from `targets` (LEAD for targets)
2. All window functions from `price_features` (LAG, AVG OVER, STDDEV OVER)
3. Simple aggregations from `daily_prices`, `weather_agg`, `sentiment_agg`

### What Stays as Views:
- All the other feature views (correlation, seasonality, crush margins, etc.)
- These already exist as separate views and can be JOINed cleanly

---

## üìã EXECUTION STEPS

### Step 1: Create Materialized Price Features Table

**Table Name:** `models.price_features_materialized`  
**Purpose:** Pre-compute all price-related window functions  
**Size Estimate:** ~1,250 rows √ó 18 columns ‚âà 0.02 MB

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `cbi-v14.models.price_features_materialized` AS
WITH daily_prices AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE(time) as date,
        AVG(close) as close_price,
        SUM(volume) as volume
    FROM `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.soybean_oil_prices`
    WHERE symbol = 'ZL'
    GROUP BY DATE(time)
),
targets AS (
    SELECT 
        date,
        close_price as zl_price_current,
        LEAD(close_price, 7) OVER (ORDER BY date) as target_1w,
        LEAD(close_price, 30) OVER (ORDER BY date) as target_1m,
        LEAD(close_price, 90) OVER (ORDER BY date) as target_3m,
        LEAD(close_price, 180) OVER (ORDER BY date) as target_6m,
        volume as zl_volume
    FROM daily_prices
)
SELECT 
    date,
    zl_price_current,
    target_1w, target_1m, target_3m, target_6m,
    zl_volume,
    LAG(zl_price_current, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) as zl_price_lag1,
    LAG(zl_price_current, 7) OVER (ORDER BY date) as zl_price_lag7,
    LAG(zl_price_current, 30) OVER (ORDER BY date) as zl_price_lag30,
    (zl_price_current - LAG(zl_price_current, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date)) / 
        NULLIF(LAG(zl_price_current, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date), 0) as return_1d,
    (zl_price_current - LAG(zl_price_current, 7) OVER (ORDER BY date)) / 
        NULLIF(LAG(zl_price_current, 7) OVER (ORDER BY date), 0) as return_7d,
    AVG(zl_price_current) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as ma_7d,
    AVG(zl_price_current) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 29 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as ma_30d,
    STDDEV(zl_price_current) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 29 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as volatility_30d
FROM targets;
```

**Safety Check:**
- ‚úÖ Creates NEW table (does not modify existing views)
- ‚úÖ Uses existing source data (no data loss risk)
- ‚úÖ Can be dropped if something goes wrong

### Step 2: Create Materialized Weather & Sentiment Tables

**Why:** These are simple aggregations but used in the main query

```sql
-- Weather aggregations
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `cbi-v14.models.weather_features_daily` AS
SELECT 
    date,
    AVG(CASE WHEN region LIKE '%Brazil%' THEN temp_max END) as brazil_temp,
    AVG(CASE WHEN region LIKE '%Brazil%' THEN precip_mm END) as brazil_precip,
    AVG(CASE WHEN region LIKE '%Argentina%' THEN temp_max END) as argentina_temp,
    AVG(CASE WHEN region LIKE '%US%' THEN temp_max END) as us_temp
FROM `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.weather_data`
GROUP BY date;

-- Sentiment aggregations
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `cbi-v14.models.sentiment_features_daily` AS
SELECT 
    DATE(timestamp) as date,
    AVG(sentiment_score) as avg_sentiment,
    STDDEV(sentiment_score) as sentiment_volatility,
    COUNT(*) as sentiment_volume
FROM `cbi-v14.forecasting_data_warehouse.social_sentiment`
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp);
```

**Safety Check:**
- ‚úÖ Creates NEW tables (separate from existing precomputed tables)
- ‚úÖ Simple GROUP BY (no complex logic)
- ‚úÖ Can verify row counts before proceeding

### Step 3: Create Final Training Table (Clean JOINs Only)

**Table Name:** `models.training_dataset_materialized`  
**Purpose:** Final BQML-compatible training dataset  
**Size Estimate:** ~1,250 rows √ó 159 columns ‚âà 0.15 MB

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `cbi-v14.models.training_dataset_materialized`
PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC(date, MONTH)
CLUSTER BY target_1w, target_1m
AS
SELECT 
    p.date,
    
    -- TARGETS (4)
    p.target_1w,
    p.target_1m,
    p.target_3m,
    p.target_6m,

```

**Safety Features:**
- ‚úÖ PARTITIONED by month for query performance
- ‚úÖ CLUSTERED by target variables for training queries
- ‚úÖ All window functions removed from JOINs
- ‚úÖ Does NOT modify existing views

### Step 4: Test BQML Compatibility

**Test Query:**
```sql
-- Test that BQML can actually use this table
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `cbi-v14.models.test_compatibility_check`
OPTIONS(
    model_type='LINEAR_REG',
    input_label_cols=['target_1w'],
    max_iterations=1
) AS
SELECT * EXCEPT(date, target_1m, target_3m, target_6m)
FROM `cbi-v14.models.training_dataset_materialized`
LIMIT 100;
```

**Expected Result:** Should complete successfully (no correlated subquery error)

**Cleanup After Test:**
```sql
DROP MODEL IF EXISTS `cbi-v14.models.test_compatibility_check`;
```

### Step 5: Validate Data Quality

```sql
-- Check row counts and NULL values
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_rows,
    COUNT(DISTINCT date) as unique_dates,
    COUNTIF(target_1w IS NULL) as null_1w,
    COUNTIF(feature_vix_stress IS NULL) as null_vix,
    COUNTIF(corr_zl_crude_7d IS NULL) as null_corr
FROM `cbi-v14.models.training_dataset_materialized`;
```

**Expected:**
- total_rows: ~1,250
- unique_dates: ~1,250 (1:1 ratio)
- null_1w: 0
- null_vix: Should be low
- null_corr: Should be acceptable

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTES

### What This Plan DOES:
- ‚úÖ Creates 3 NEW materialized tables
- ‚úÖ Tests BQML compatibility
- ‚úÖ Validates data quality

### What This Plan DOES NOT DO:
- ‚ùå Does NOT modify existing views
- ‚ùå Does NOT delete any existing objects
- ‚ùå Does NOT start training automatically
- ‚ùå Does NOT modify source data

### Rollback Plan (If Needed):
```sql
-- Delete all new tables created
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `cbi-v14.models.price_features_materialized`;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `cbi-v14.models.weather_features_daily`;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `cbi-v14.models.sentiment_features_daily`;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `cbi-v14.models.training_dataset_materialized`;
```
