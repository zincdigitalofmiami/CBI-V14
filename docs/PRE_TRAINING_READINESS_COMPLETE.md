---

## 3. ✅ CROSS-VALIDATION SETUP

### Time-Based Split Strategy (Financial Data Best Practice)

#### Recommended Split:
```
Training Set:   2020-10-21 to 2024-03-31  (80% of data)
Validation Set: 2024-04-01 to 2024-09-30  (10% of data)
Test Set:       2024-10-01 to 2025-10-13  (10% of data)
```

#### Implementation in BQML:
```sql
-- Training
CREATE MODEL ... AS
SELECT * FROM `cbi-v14.models.training_dataset_final_v1`
WHERE date <= '2024-03-31'
AND target_1w IS NOT NULL;

-- Validation (use ML.EVALUATE with date filter)
SELECT * FROM ML.EVALUATE(
    MODEL `cbi-v14.models.your_model`,
    (SELECT * FROM `cbi-v14.models.training_dataset_final_v1`
     WHERE date BETWEEN '2024-04-01' AND '2024-09-30')
);

-- Test (final holdout)
SELECT * FROM ML.EVALUATE(
    MODEL `cbi-v14.models.your_model`,
    (SELECT * FROM `cbi-v14.models.training_dataset_final_v1`
     WHERE date >= '2024-10-01')
);
```

#### Walk-Forward Validation (Advanced):
For production, implement rolling window validation:
- Train on N months
- Validate on next 1 month
- Roll forward 1 month
- Repeat

**Status**: ✅ Framework defined, ready to implement

---

## 4. ✅ HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK

### Systematic Tuning Approach

   - Dropout: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
   - Learning rate: 0.001, 0.01
   - Batch size: 32, 64, 128

2. **Boosted Tree Regressor**
   - Max iterations: 50, 100, 200
   - Learning rate: 0.05, 0.1, 0.2
   - Max depth: 6, 8, 10
   - Subsample: 0.7, 0.8, 0.9

3. **ARIMA Plus**
   - Auto-tuned by BQML
   - Different time series settings

#### Tracking System:
```sql
-- Create hyperparameter experiment log
CREATE TABLE `cbi-v14.models.hyperparameter_experiments` (
    experiment_id STRING,
    model_name STRING,
    model_type STRING,
    hyperparameters JSON,
    train_mae FLOAT64,
    train_rmse FLOAT64,

    training_time_seconds FLOAT64,
    created_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
);
```

**Status**: ✅ Framework designed

---

## 5. ✅ MODEL EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

### Regime-Specific Performance Metrics

#### Market Regimes to Track:
1. **Volatility Regimes**
   - Low (VIX < 20): Expect lower errors
   - Medium (VIX 20-30): Normal performance
   - High (VIX > 30): Expect higher errors

2. **Price Trend Regimes**
   - Bull market (rising prices)
   - Bear market (falling prices)
   - Sideways (range-bound)

3. **Seasonal Regimes**
   - US Planting (Apr-May)
   - US Harvest (Sep-Nov)
   - Brazil Harvest (Feb-Mar)

#### Evaluation Metrics:
```sql
-- Regime-specific evaluation
WITH predictions AS (
    SELECT 
        p.*,
        date,
        CASE 
            WHEN vix_level < 20 THEN 'Low Volatility'
            WHEN vix_level < 30 THEN 'Medium Volatility'
            ELSE 'High Volatility'
        END as regime,
        target_1w as actual,
        predicted_target_1w as predicted
    FROM ML.PREDICT(MODEL `cbi-v14.models.your_model`, ...)
)
SELECT 
    regime,
    COUNT(*) as samples,
    AVG(ABS(actual - predicted)) as MAE,
    SQRT(AVG(POWER(actual - predicted, 2))) as RMSE,
    AVG(ABS(actual - predicted) / actual) * 100 as MAPE,
    COUNTIF(SIGN(actual - LAG(actual) OVER (ORDER BY date)) = 
            SIGN(predicted - LAG(actual) OVER (ORDER BY date))) / 
    COUNT(*) * 100 as directional_accuracy
FROM predictions
GROUP BY regime
ORDER BY regime;
```

#### Baseline Comparison:
```
1. Naive baseline (tomorrow = today)
2. Moving average baseline (7-day MA)
3. ARIMA baseline
4. Your neural network models
```

**Status**: ✅ Framework defined

---

## 6. ✅ SEASONALITY HANDLING

### Status: FIXED & VALIDATED

#### Problem Identified:
- `vw_seasonality_features` used correlated subquery
- Caused BQML incompatibility
- Blocked materialization

#### Solution Implemented:
```sql
-- Pre-calculate monthly standard deviations (eliminates correlated subquery)
monthly_stddev AS (
    SELECT 
        month,
        STDDEV(price) as stddev_price_for_month
    FROM price_data
    GROUP BY month
)
-- Then join cleanly (no correlation)
LEFT JOIN monthly_stddev mstd ON p.month = mstd.month
```

#### Features Now Available:
1. **seasonal_index** (1.0 = average month)
   - Values: 0.88 to 1.12 typically
   - November: 0.882 (harvest pressure, prices typically lower)
   - April: 1.089 (pre-planting, prices typically higher)

2. **monthly_zscore** (how unusual is current price)
   - -2 to +2 = normal
   - >+2 = unusually high for the month
   - <-2 = unusually low for the month

3. **yoy_change** (year-over-year change %)
   - Captures long-term trends
   - NULL for first 365 days (expected)

#### Validation:
```
✅ 1,258 rows materialized
✅ 0 NULLs in seasonal_index
✅ 0 NULLs in monthly_zscore
✅ 365 NULLs in yoy_change (expected - first year)
✅ Successfully integrated into training table
✅ BQML compatibility confirmed
```

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 7. ✅ SIGNAL IMPORTANCE ANALYSIS

### Framework for Feature Attribution

#### SHAP-Style Feature Importance (BQML Native):
```sql
-- After training, analyze feature importance
SELECT *
FROM ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE(MODEL `cbi-v14.models.your_model`)
ORDER BY importance DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

#### Ablation Study Framework:
```
Train models with progressive feature removal:
1. All 159 features (baseline)
2. Remove Big 8 signals (measure impact)
3. Remove correlations (measure impact)
4. Remove lead/lag signals (measure impact)
5. etc.

Compare performance degradation
```

#### Regime-Specific Importance:
```sql
-- Analyze which features matter most in each regime
-- High volatility vs low volatility
-- Bull markets vs bear markets
-- Different seasons
```

#### Feature Groups to Analyze:
- Price features (14)
- Big 8 signals (9)
- Correlations (35)
- Seasonality (3)
- Fundamentals (crush margins, China, Brazil) (25)
- Geopolitics (Trump-Xi, trade war) (19)
- Events (16)
- Lead/Lag (28)
- Weather (4)
- Sentiment (3)
- Metadata (3)

**Status**: ✅ Framework ready

## 8. ✅ PERFORMANCE MONITORING

### Drift Detection & Alerting Infrastructure

#### Feature Drift Monitoring:
```sql
-- Track distribution changes over time
CREATE TABLE `cbi-v14.models.feature_drift_monitoring` (
    monitoring_date DATE,
    feature_name STRING,
    mean_value FLOAT64,
    stddev_value FLOAT64,
    min_value FLOAT64,
    max_value FLOAT64,
    null_percentage FLOAT64,
    drift_score FLOAT64,  -- KL divergence or similar
    alert_triggered BOOL
);

-- Weekly monitoring job
INSERT INTO `cbi-v14.models.feature_drift_monitoring`
SELECT 
    CURRENT_DATE() as monitoring_date,
    'zl_price_current' as feature_name,
    AVG(zl_price_current) as mean_value,
    STDDEV(zl_price_current) as stddev_value,
    MIN(zl_price_current) as min_value,
    MAX(zl_price_current) as max_value,
    COUNTIF(zl_price_current IS NULL) / COUNT(*) * 100 as null_percentage,
    -- Calculate drift score comparing to baseline distribution
    NULL as drift_score,  -- Implement KL divergence
    FALSE as alert_triggered
FROM `cbi-v14.models.training_dataset_final_v1`
WHERE date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);
```

#### Prediction Quality Monitoring:
```sql
-- Track real-time prediction errors
CREATE TABLE `cbi-v14.models.prediction_quality_log` (
    prediction_date DATE,
    horizon STRING,  -- '1w', '1m', '3m', '6m'
    predicted_value FLOAT64,
    actual_value FLOAT64,
    absolute_error FLOAT64,
    percentage_error FLOAT64,
    regime STRING,
    alert_triggered BOOL
);

-- Daily job after actual values are known
-- Compare predictions to actuals
-- Alert if MAE > threshold
```

#### Automated Alerts:
```
1. Feature drift > 2 standard deviations
2. Prediction error > historical baseline + 2σ
3. NULL percentage spike in key features
4. Model performance degradation
5. Data freshness issues
```
