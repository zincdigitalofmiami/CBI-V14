## 🚫 WHAT'S MISSING (Why You Can't Use It Yet)

### The Missing Bridge:
```
[Models Trained] → ❌ [No Predictions] → ❌ [No Live Dashboard]
```

### Specifically:
1. **Models aren't deployed** to generate predictions
2. **No daily automation** running
3. **Dashboard not live** on the internet
4. **No predictions** feeding your signals

### Translation:
**It's like having a Ferrari fully built in the factory but not delivered to your driveway**
