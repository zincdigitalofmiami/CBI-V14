# BigQuery Deployment - Final Status
**Date:** November 18, 2025  
**Status:** ⚠️ **NOT READY** - Scripts Ready, Execution Pending

## ✅ What's Ready

### Scripts Created (All Ready)
- ✅ `scripts/deployment/deploy_bq_schema.sh` - Schema deployment script
- ✅ `PRODUCTION_READY_BQ_SCHEMA.sql` - Complete schema DDL (55+ tables)
- ✅ `scripts/deployment/create_overlay_views.sql` - 31 overlay views
- ✅ `scripts/migration/migrate_master_features.py` - Master features migration
- ✅ `scripts/validation/validate_bq_deployment.py` - Validation battery

### Documentation Complete
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` - Step-by-step execution guide
- ✅ `BQ_CURRENT_STATE_REPORT.md` - Current state analysis
- ✅ `BQ_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md` - Detailed checklist
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_SCRIPTS_READY.md` - Script status summary

## ❌ What's Missing (Not Executed Yet)

### BigQuery Infrastructure
- ❌ **Datasets Missing:** `regimes`, `drivers`, `dim`, `ops`
- ❌ **Tables Missing:** All DataBento tables, all prefixed raw_intelligence tables, all signal tables, all MES training tables, regime/driver/dim/ops tables
- ❌ **Views Missing:** All 31 overlay/compatibility views
- ❌ **Data Migration:** `features.master_features` not rebuilt from `master_features_canonical`

### External Drive Storage
- ❌ `/Volumes/Satechi Hub/Projects/CBI-V14/TrainingData/live/` - Not created
- ❌ `/Volumes/Satechi Hub/Projects/CBI-V14/TrainingData/live_continuous/` - Not created

## 🚀 Execution Sequence (When Ready)

### Phase 1: Schema Deployment (15 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/kirkmusick/Documents/GitHub/CBI-V14
./scripts/deployment/deploy_bq_schema.sh
```
**This will create:**
- All 12 datasets (including missing: regimes, drivers, dim, ops)
- All 55+ tables (DataBento, raw_intelligence, signals, training, etc.)

### Phase 2: Create Folders (2 minutes)
```bash
mkdir -p "/Volumes/Satechi Hub/Projects/CBI-V14/TrainingData/live"
mkdir -p "/Volumes/Satechi Hub/Projects/CBI-V14/TrainingData/live_continuous"
```

### Phase 3: Create Overlay Views (30 minutes)
```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < scripts/deployment/create_overlay_views.sql
```
**This will create:**
- All 31 overlay/compatibility views

### Phase 4: Data Migration (2-4 hours)
```bash
python3 scripts/migration/migrate_master_features.py
```
**This will:**
- Rebuild `features.master_features` with prefixed columns
- Migrate data from `master_features_canonical`

### Phase 5: Validation (30 minutes)
```bash
python3 scripts/validation/validate_bq_deployment.py
```
**This will verify:**
- All datasets exist
- All tables exist
- All views exist
- Data integrity
- Column prefixing

## 📊 Current State Summary

| Component | Status | Action Required |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Schema Script | ✅ Ready | Run `deploy_bq_schema.sh` |
| Overlay Views SQL | ✅ Ready | Run `create_overlay_views.sql` |
| Migration Script | ✅ Ready | Run `migrate_master_features.py` |
| Validation Script | ✅ Ready | Run `validate_bq_deployment.py` |
| BigQuery Datasets | ❌ Missing | Created by Phase 1 |
| BigQuery Tables | ❌ Missing | Created by Phase 1 |
| BigQuery Views | ❌ Missing | Created by Phase 3 |
| External Folders | ❌ Missing | Created by Phase 2 |
| Data Migration | ❌ Pending | Executed by Phase 4 |

## 🎯 Readiness Checklist

- [x] All scripts created and tested
- [x] All documentation complete
- [x] Execution plan documented
- [ ] Phase 1 executed (Schema deployment)
- [ ] Phase 2 executed (Folder creation)
- [ ] Phase 3 executed (Overlay views)
- [ ] Phase 4 executed (Data migration)
- [ ] Phase 5 executed (Validation)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Do NOT run Phase 1 until ready** - This will create production infrastructure
2. **Backup existing tables first** - If `master_features_canonical` has data, back it up
3. **Test in dev first** - Consider testing scripts on a dev project if available
4. **Monitor costs** - BigQuery operations may incur costs during migration

## 📋 Pre-Flight Checklist

Before executing Phase 1, verify:
- [ ] BigQuery API credentials configured
- [ ] Python dependencies installed (`google-cloud-bigquery`)
- [ ] External drive mounted at `/Volumes/Satechi Hub/`
- [ ] Sufficient BigQuery quota available
- [ ] Backup plan for existing data

**Status:** All tooling ready, awaiting execution  
**Next Action:** Execute Phase 1 when ready to deploy
