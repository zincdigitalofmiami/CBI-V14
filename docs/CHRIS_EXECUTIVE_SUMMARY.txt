VEGAS INTEL PAGE (For Kevin's Casino Operations)
================================================================================

PURPOSE

Help Kevin's sales team identify which casino customers are most likely to 
need soybean oil (for fryers) and when they'll need it, turning forecasting 
intelligence into revenue opportunities.


HOW IT WORKS

STEP 1: CUSTOMER INTELLIGENCE (from Glide)
    Kevin's team tracks ~3,000+ Vegas restaurants/casinos in Glide app. Data 
    includes: customer relationship status, historical order volumes, last 
    contact date, decision-maker info.

STEP 2: FRYER MATH ENGINE
    Calculates soybean oil needs based on:
        • Restaurant square footage
        • Cuisine type (Italian uses less oil than Asian/fried food)
        • Convention calendar (high traffic = more fryer use)
        • Vegas event calendar (big events = more customers = more oil)

STEP 3: PROCUREMENT TIMING PREDICTION
    Cross-references:
        • Last order date + typical reorder cycle
        • Upcoming Vegas events (conventions, shows, holidays)
        • Seasonal patterns
        • Current inventory estimates

STEP 4: ACTIONABLE SALES ALERTS

What Kevin's Team Sees:
    • "Hot Leads" List: Top 20 accounts likely to order in next 2-4 weeks
    • Call Priority Score: Who to call first
    • Talking Points:
        - "Convention season starts in 3 weeks - time to stock up?"
        - "ZL prices forecast to rise 5% next month - lock in now?"
        - "You typically reorder around now based on last year"
    • Revenue Potential: Estimated order size based on historical patterns


EXAMPLE ALERT:

    HIGH PRIORITY: Caesars Palace - Italian Restaurant
    
    • Last order: 45 days ago (typical cycle: 50 days)
    • Big convention next week (5,000 attendees)
    • Forecast: Prices up 4% in 2 weeks
    • Suggested action: Call TODAY with price lock offer
    • Est. order value: $12,500


THE INTELLIGENCE EDGE

NORMAL SALES: 
    "Hey, do you need oil?"

VEGAS INTEL SALES: 
    "Hi, I see you have the National Restaurateurs Convention next week with 
    5,000 attendees. Based on your fryer capacity and typical usage, you'll 
    burn through inventory fast. Also, our forecast shows prices increasing 4% 
    in two weeks. Want to lock in current pricing for a larger order now?"


INTEGRATION WITH PROCUREMENT DASHBOARD

    • If ZL forecast shows price increase coming: Push customers to order NOW
    • If ZL forecast shows price decrease coming: Kevin can stock up, offer 
      deals later
    • If supply disruption forecast: Proactive outreach to lock in supply
    • If China cancellations: Prices likely to drop, adjust sales strategy


RESULT

Turns Kevin's sales team into consultative advisors who call customers at 
exactly the right time with exactly the right message, backed by 
institutional-grade forecasting intelligence.


================================================================================
MODEL PERFORMANCE TARGETS
================================================================================

1-MONTH FORECAST:
    • Target: 2-4% MAPE (beats current 7.8% baseline)
    • Directional accuracy: 65-70% (better than coin flip)
    • Confidence intervals: 80-90% coverage

3-MONTH FORECAST:
    • Target: 3-6% MAPE
    • Strategic planning timeframe

6-MONTH FORECAST:
    • Target: 4-8% MAPE
    • Contract negotiation timeframe

BUSINESS VALUE:
Even 3-5% MAPE provides institutional-grade insights for procurement timing. 
The goal isn't perfect prediction—it's consistently better decisions than gut 
feel or simple trend analysis.
