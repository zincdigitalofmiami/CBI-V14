## 🔍 LICENSE STATUS CHECK

**I cannot directly access your Google Cloud Console**, but here's what you need to check:

### Quick Check URLs:

1. **License Management:**
   - https://console.cloud.google.com/gemini/code-assist/licenses?project=cbi-v14
   - Look for: Available licenses, Assigned licenses

2. **Admin for Gemini:**
   - https://console.cloud.google.com/gemini/admin?project=cbi-v14
   - Check: License assignments, Subscriptions

3. **Billing Account:**
   - https://console.cloud.google.com/billing?project=cbi-v14
   - Check: Active subscriptions, Gemini Code Assist

## 📋 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### If You See Licenses Available:
- ✅ You have licenses but they're not assigned
- **Action:** Assign license to your account (`zincmiami@gmail.com`)

### If You See No Licenses:
- ❌ No licenses purchased for project `cbi-v14`
- **Action:** Either purchase license OR remove project setting to use individual tier

### If License is Assigned to Someone Else:
- ⚠️ License exists but assigned to different user
- **Action:** Request reassignment from billing administrator

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP

**Since you're busy, try this quick fix:**

1. `Cmd + Shift + P` → "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"
2. Delete: `"geminicodeassist.project": "cbi-v14"`
3. Save and restart Cursor
4. Test: `Cmd + Shift + P` → "Gemini: Open Chat"

**This removes the enterprise license requirement** and may allow the extension to work with individual tier.
