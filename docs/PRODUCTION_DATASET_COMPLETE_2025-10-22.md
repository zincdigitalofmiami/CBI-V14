- Could not be materialized
- **Impact**: Minimal (month/quarter metadata provides basic seasonality)
- **Future**: Can be added when view is refactored

### Model Performance on Test:
- Initial test R¬≤ was negative (expected on 100-row sample)
- **Not a concern**: Test was only for BQML compatibility
- Real training on full 1,251 rows will perform better

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS - READY FOR TRAINING

### Option A: Train Single Model (Quick Test)
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `cbi-v14.models.zl_neural_v1`
OPTIONS(
    model_type='DNN_REGRESSOR',
    hidden_units=[128, 64, 32],
    activation_fn='RELU',
    dropout=0.2,
    input_label_cols=['target_1w'],
    data_split_method='AUTO_SPLIT'
) AS
SELECT * EXCEPT(date, target_1m, target_3m, target_6m)
FROM `cbi-v14.models.training_dataset_production_v1`
WHERE target_1w IS NOT NULL;
```

### Option B: Train Multiple Horizons
Train 4 models (1w, 1m, 3m, 6m forecasts):
```sql
-- 1-week model
CREATE MODEL `cbi-v14.models.zl_dnn_1w_production_v1` ...
SELECT * EXCEPT(date, target_1m, target_3m, target_6m) ...

-- 1-month model  
CREATE MODEL `cbi-v14.models.zl_dnn_1m_production_v1` ...
SELECT * EXCEPT(date, target_1w, target_3m, target_6m) ...

-- And so on...
```

### Option C: Train Ensemble (Best Performance)
Train multiple model types per horizon:
- DNN Regressor
- Boosted Tree Regressor
- Linear Regression
- ARIMA Plus
Then ensemble the predictions

## üîß MAINTENANCE & UPDATES

### Refresh Strategy:
Currently: **Static snapshot** (as of Oct 22, 2025)

### To Add New Data:
1. Run incremental refresh on source tables
2. Re-materialize feature tables (or use refresh procedure)
3. Rebuild training_dataset_production_v1
4. Retrain models

### To Add Seasonality Features (Future):
1. Fix `vw_seasonality_features` to remove correlated subqueries
2. Materialize the fixed view
3. Add 3 columns back to training table
4. Update to 159 total features

---

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked:
1. ‚úÖ Materializing ALL window functions before JOINs
2. ‚úÖ Staging ‚Üí Production workflow with validation
3. ‚úÖ Partitioning and clustering for performance
4. ‚úÖ Testing BQML compatibility before full promotion
5. ‚úÖ Using CLONE for efficient production promotion

### Challenges Overcome:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Correlated subquery errors from nested window functions
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't cluster by FLOAT columns (switched to date)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è `vw_seasonality_features` itself had correlated subqueries
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple rounds of materialization needed

### Best Practices Established:
1. Always materialize views with window functions before using in CREATE MODEL
2. Test BQML compatibility on small sample before full training
3. Use staging environment for all development work
4. Partition by time periods and cluster by date for time-series data
5. Keep metadata tracking tables for lineage and validation
