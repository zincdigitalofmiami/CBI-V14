# Deployment

All deployment documentation organized by status.

## Structure

- **`active/`** - Current deployment configs and status
- **`old/`** - Historical deployments
- **`new/`** - Pending deployments

## Usage

1. New deployment → Create in `new/`
2. Currently deploying → Move to `active/`
3. Completed/archived → Move to `old/`

## Examples

- `active/current-deployment-status.md`
- `old/DEPLOY_CONSOLE_NOW.md`
- `old/DEPLOYMENT_BLOCKED_SUMMARY.md`
