## BEARISH BIAS ANALYSIS REPORT
**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-23 14:51:43
**Model:** V3 Boosted Tree (all horizons)
**Timeframe:** October 2023 - October 2025 (24 months)

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Bias Severity:** SEVERE
**Confidence Level:** HIGH

Current V3 model forecasts a **-15.87% decline** over 6 months, but historical data shows 
an average **+3.38% change**. This represents a deviation of **19.25 
percentage points** (4.14 standard deviations from mean).

### KEY FINDINGS

1. **ACTUAL MARKET BEHAVIOR (2-Year Historical)**
   - Average 6-month price change: +3.38%
   - Bearish periods: 44.2%
   - Bullish periods: 55.8%
   - Market is essentially **neutral with slight bullish bias**

2. **MODEL FORECAST vs REALITY**
   - Model predicts: -15.87% (strongly bearish)
   - Historical average: +3.38%
   - **Deviation: -19.25 percentage points**
   - This is **4.1x normal market volatility**

3. **ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED**
   a) No recent trend bias
      - Recent 6-month average: +18.98%
      - Overall average: +3.38%
      
   b) Balanced training data
      - Late 2023 period: -8.98% (extreme bearish)
      - Model trained on this data learned bearish bias

4. **SPECIFIC EVIDENCE**
   - Late 2023 saw -17% to -18% drops (pandemic aftermath recovery)
   - 2024-2025 shows strong recovery (+15% to +25% in recent months)
   - Model has not adapted to regime change

### RECOMMENDATIONS

**IMMEDIATE (Critical):**
1. ‚ùå **DO NOT USE -15.87% FORECAST FOR PRODUCTION**
   - Forecast is 4 standard deviations from historical mean
   - Statistically unreliable prediction
   
2. ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENT ENSEMBLE MODEL**
   - Combine V3 Boosted + ARIMA (trend-following)
   - ARIMA will capture recent bullish momentum
   - Reduces systematic bearish bias
   
3. üîÑ **ADD REGIME DETECTION FEATURES**
   - VIX regime indicators (high/normal/low volatility)
   - Trend momentum indicators (RSI, moving averages)
   - Market regime classification (bear/bull/neutral)

**SHORT-TERM (1-2 Weeks):**
1. ‚è≥ **EVALUATE AUTOML RESULTS**
   - AutoML may have better regime adaptation
   - Check if AutoML shows similar bearish bias
   
2. üìä **IMPLEMENT WALK-FORWARD VALIDATION**
   - Retrain model monthly on rolling window
   - Prevents overfitting to old bearish periods
   
3. üéØ **ADJUST TARGET WEIGHTS**
   - Reduce weight on 6-month horizon (too uncertain)
   - Focus on 1-week and 1-month (better accuracy)

**LONG-TERM (1-2 Months):**
1. üß† **ADD ADAPTIVE LEARNING**
   - Implement online learning / model retraining
   - Adjust to new market regimes automatically
   
2. üìà **ENHANCE FEATURE SET**
   - Add option flow data (put/call ratios)
   - Add positioning data (COT commercial vs speculative)
   - Add supply chain indicators

### PRODUCTION DECISION

**RECOMMENDATION: SUSPEND -15.87% FORECAST, DEPLOY ENSEMBLE**

**Rationale:**
- Current forecast deviates 4œÉ from historical mean (statistically extreme)
- Model shows systematic bearish bias from 2023 training data
- Recent market behavior (+15-25%) contradicts forecast direction
- Ensemble with ARIMA will provide more balanced view

**Action Items:**
1. Create ensemble model (60% V3 Boosted + 40% ARIMA)
2. Test ensemble against last 6 months actual data
3. If ensemble shows <5% MAPE and <2œÉ deviation, deploy
4. Add warning label to dashboard: "Forecast based on historical patterns"

### TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Analysis Method:**
- Backtested 508 trading days (Oct 2023 - Oct 2025)
- Compared actual vs model-implied predictions
- Statistical significance testing (œÉ analysis)

**Data Quality:**
- All data validated from BigQuery
- No missing values in critical periods
- Training dataset: 1,263 rows, 28 features

**Limitations:**
- Did not perform full walk-forward retraining
- Used current model on historical data (approximation)
- AutoML models not yet available for comparison
