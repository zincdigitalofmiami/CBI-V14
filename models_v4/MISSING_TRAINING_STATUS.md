# MISSING TRAINING COMPONENTS STATUS
**Date:** October 23, 2025 - 16:15 UTC
**Priority:** Complete remaining V4 models before production deployment

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TRAINING

### V3 Models (Production):
- ‚úÖ 4 Boosted Tree Enriched models (1w, 1m, 3m, 6m)
- ‚úÖ Validation layer integrated
- ‚úÖ All operational and serving forecasts

### V4 Models (Isolated):
- ‚úÖ 2 Fixed DNN models (1w, 1m) - Fixed normalization issue
- ‚úÖ 4 ARIMA+ models (1w, 1m, 3m, 6m) - Validated time series
- ‚úÖ Forward curve builder (181 daily points)

## ‚ùå MISSING TRAINING

### 1. AutoML Models (CRITICAL) ‚ùå
**Status:** FAILED due to invalid `max_trials` parameter  
**Models Needed:** 4 (`zl_automl_1w_v4`, `zl_automl_1m_v4`, `zl_automl_3m_v4`, `zl_automl_6m_v4`)  
**Issue:** Removed unsupported `max_trials` parameter  
**Action:** Re-run training script  
**Script:** `scripts/train_v4_automl.py`  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Estimated Cost:** $6-8

### 2. Ensemble Models ‚ùå
**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Models Needed:** 4 ensemble views  
**Components:** 40% Boosted V3 + 30% AutoML V4 + 20% DNN V4 + 10% ARIMA V4  
**Blocking:** Wait for AutoML completion  
**Script:** `scripts/train_v4_ensemble.py` (needs to be created)  
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour  
**Estimated Cost:** $0 (views, not models)

### 3. Walk-Forward Validation ‚ùå
**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Purpose:** Monthly retraining with rolling windows  
**Components:** 
- Rolling training window (12 months)
- Monthly retrain schedule
- Performance drift detection
**Script:** `scripts/walk_forward_validation.py` (needs to be created)  
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours to implement  
**Estimated Cost:** $5-10/month (ongoing)

### 4. LSTM Models ‚ùå
**Status:** NOT PLANNED  
**Note:** Not in current V4 plan. BigQuery ML doesn't support LSTM natively.  
**Alternative:** Time-aware features in DNN models  
**Action:** Skip unless explicitly requested

---

## üîß IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

### Priority 1: Fix AutoML Training (NEXT 30 MINUTES)
```bash
cd /Users/zincdigital/CBI-V14
python3 scripts/train_v4_automl.py
```

### Priority 2: Create Ensemble Script (NEXT 1 HOUR)
After AutoML completes, create ensemble views

### Priority 3: Implement Walk-Forward (NEXT WEEK)
Set up monthly retraining pipeline

## üí∞ REMAINING COSTS

| Component | Cost | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| AutoML (4 models) | $6-8 | ‚úÖ Script fixed, ready to run |
| Ensemble (views) | $0 | ‚è≥ Waiting for AutoML |
| Walk-Forward (setup) | $2 | ‚è≥ Not started |
| Walk-Forward (monthly) | $5-10 | ‚è≥ Not started |
| **Total Remaining** | **$13-20** | |

## üìä TRAINING PROGRESS SUMMARY

**V3 Models:** 100% Complete ‚úÖ  
**V4 Models:** 60% Complete (6/10 models trained)  
**AutoML:** 0% Complete ‚ùå (Failed, need to retry)  
**Ensemble:** 0% Complete ‚ùå (Waiting for AutoML)  
**Walk-Forward:** 0% Complete ‚ùå (Not started)

**Overall Completion:** 75% (Core models done, advanced features pending)

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION

**For Production Right Now:**
- ‚úÖ Use enriched V3 models (fully operational)
- ‚úÖ Validation layer active
- ‚úÖ All forecasts statistically validated

**For Full V4 System:**
1. Run AutoML training tonight (4-6 hours background)
2. Create ensemble models tomorrow
3. Implement walk-forward next week
4. Deploy V4 as optional enhancement

**Current system is production-ready with V3 enriched models.**
