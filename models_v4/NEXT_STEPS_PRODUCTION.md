## ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (This Week)

### Priority 1: Automated Monitoring Dashboard

**Goal:** Real-time feature health monitoring

**Tasks:**
1. Create BigQuery scheduled query to track feature drift daily
2. Set up Cloud Monitoring alerts for:
   - `news_total_articles` drops below 10/day
   - `social_post_count` drops below 50/day
   - `news_tariff_mentions` spikes above 20/day (regime change)
   - Forecast validation layer corrects >3 predictions/day
3. Build Looker Studio dashboard showing:
   - Feature freshness (last update timestamp)
   - Feature importance trends (30-day rolling)
   - Validation rate (% of forecasts corrected)
   - Model MAPE over time

**SQL Template:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `cbi-v14.monitoring.daily_feature_health` AS
WITH feature_stats AS (
  SELECT
    CURRENT_DATE() AS check_date,
    COUNT(*) AS news_articles,
    SUM(social_post_count) AS social_posts,
    AVG(social_avg_sentiment) AS avg_sentiment,
    MAX(news_tariff_mentions) AS max_tariff_mentions
  FROM `cbi-v14.models.training_dataset`
  WHERE date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
)
SELECT
  *,
  CASE WHEN news_articles < 10 THEN 'CRITICAL' 
       WHEN news_articles < 50 THEN 'WARNING' 
       ELSE 'OK' END AS news_health,
  CASE WHEN social_posts < 50 THEN 'CRITICAL' 
       WHEN social_posts < 200 THEN 'WARNING' 
       ELSE 'OK' END AS social_health
FROM feature_stats;
```

**Schedule:** Run daily at 00:30 UTC (after data refresh)

---

### Priority 2: Optimize Feature Refresh Rates

**Goal:** Update critical features more frequently than non-critical

**Current:** All features update daily
**Target:** Differential update schedule

**Proposed Schedule:**
```python
REFRESH_SCHEDULES = {
    # Critical (every 6 hours)
    "critical": [
        "social_avg_sentiment",
        "social_bearish_posts",
        "news_tariff_mentions",
        "news_china_mentions"
    ],
    # High (daily)
    "high": [
        "news_biofuel_mentions",
        "news_7d_avg_articles",
        "social_sentiment_volatility"
    ],
    # Medium (weekly)
    "medium": [
        "news_lobbying_mentions",
        "news_legislation_mentions"
    ],
    # Low (monthly)
    "low": [
        "news_avg_content_length"
    ]
}
```

**Implementation:**
1. Create separate Cloud Functions for each refresh tier
2. Use Cloud Scheduler to trigger at different frequencies
3. Update only changed features in training dataset (append-only)
4. Add `feature_update_timestamp` column to track freshness

**Cost Impact:** +$0.50/month (additional queries)
**Performance Impact:** Critical features always fresh

---

### Priority 3: Ensemble Model with Dynamic Weighting

**Goal:** Adjust model weights based on current market regime

**Current:** Fixed weights (100% Boosted Tree Enriched)
**Target:** Dynamic ensemble based on news intensity

**Proposed Weighting Logic:**
```python
def calculate_ensemble_weights(current_data):
    """
    Dynamically weight models based on current regime
    """
    # Get current regime signals
    tariff_news = current_data['news_tariff_mentions']
    vix = current_data['vix_current']
    social_bearish = current_data['social_bearish_posts']
    
    # Determine regime
    if tariff_news > 15 or vix > 30:
        regime = 'CRISIS'
    elif tariff_news > 5 or vix > 20:
        regime = 'VOLATILE'
    else:
        regime = 'NORMAL'
    
    # Set weights based on regime
    if regime == 'CRISIS':
        return {
            'boosted_enriched': 0.50,  # Reduce boosted tree (overreacts in crisis)
            'arima': 0.30,              # Increase ARIMA (trend-following)
            'linear': 0.20              # Add linear for stability
        }
    elif regime == 'VOLATILE':
        return {
            'boosted_enriched': 0.70,
            'arima': 0.20,
            'linear': 0.10
        }
    else:
        return {
            'boosted_enriched': 1.00,  # Use enriched model solo (best performance)
            'arima': 0.00,
            'linear': 0.00
        }
```

**Implementation:**
1. Create `vw_dynamic_ensemble` view in BigQuery
2. Add `/api/v4/ensemble` endpoint with regime-aware weighting
3. Test on historical crisis periods (Q4 2023, Q1 2024)
4. Compare MAPE against fixed-weight ensemble

**Expected Improvement:** 10-15% better MAPE during crisis periods

---

## ðŸ“Š MEDIUM-TERM ENHANCEMENTS (Next 30 Days)

### 1. Historical News Backfill

```python
from scrape_creators import get_trump_posts

def fetch_trump_truth_social():
    """
    Fetch latest Trump Truth Social posts
    API Key: B1TOgQvMVSV6TDglqB8lJ2cirqi2
    """
    api_key = "B1TOgQvMVSV6TDglqB8lJ2cirqi2"
    posts = get_trump_posts(api_key, limit=100)
    
    # Filter for trade/ag/policy mentions
    relevant_posts = []
    keywords = ['tariff', 'china', 'trade', 'farmer', 'agriculture', 'soy', 'oil']
    
    for post in posts:
        if any(kw in post['content'].lower() for kw in keywords):
            relevant_posts.append({
                'timestamp': post['timestamp'],
                'content': post['content'],
                'sentiment': analyze_sentiment(post['content']),
                'policy_threat_score': calculate_policy_threat(post['content'])
            })
    
    return relevant_posts

def calculate_policy_threat(text):
    """
    Score 0-10: How likely this post leads to policy action
    """
    # High threat indicators
    if 'will' in text and ('tariff' in text or 'sanction' in text):
        return 9
    # Medium threat
    elif 'considering' in text or 'looking at' in text:
        return 6
    # Low threat (just complaining)
    elif 'terrible' in text or 'unfair' in text:
        return 3
    else:
        return 1
```

**Features to Add:**

### 3. Forward Curves & Term Structure

**Goal:** Generate smooth daily price forecasts (0-180 days)

**Current:** Discrete forecasts (1W, 1M, 3M, 6M)
**Target:** 181 daily points via spline interpolation

**Implementation:**
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline

def build_forward_curve(forecasts):
    """
    Interpolate smooth curve from discrete forecasts
    """
    # Anchor points
    days = np.array([0, 7, 30, 90, 180])
    prices = np.array([
        forecasts['current'],
        forecasts['1w'],
        forecasts['1m'],
        forecasts['3m'],
        forecasts['6m']
    ])
    
    # Cubic spline interpolation
    cs = CubicSpline(days, prices)
    
    # Generate daily points
    forward_days = np.arange(0, 181)
    forward_prices = cs(forward_days)
    
    return pd.DataFrame({
        'days_ahead': forward_days,
        'forward_price': forward_prices,
        'confidence_lower': forward_prices - (forecasts['mae'] * 1.96),
        'confidence_upper': forward_prices + (forecasts['mae'] * 1.96)
    })
```

**API Endpoint:** `/api/v4/forward-curve`
**Dashboard Use:** Interactive curve chart (recharts)
**Trading Use:** Calculate optimal hedge points

## ðŸ”® LONG-TERM VISION (Next 90-180 Days)

### 1. Regime-Specific Models

Train separate models for each market regime:
- **Normal Model:** Optimized for VIX < 20, low news
- **Trade War Model:** Optimized for high tariff news
- **Crisis Model:** Optimized for VIX > 30, high volatility

**Ensemble Logic:**
```python
if regime == 'CRISIS':
    prediction = crisis_model.predict()
elif regime == 'TRADE_WAR':
    prediction = trade_war_model.predict()
else:
    prediction = normal_model.predict()
```

**Expected Improvement:** 20-30% better MAPE during regime transitions

---

### 2. AutoML Experimentation

**Current:** Boosted Tree manual tuning
**Target:** Let Google AutoML find optimal architecture

**Process:**
1. Submit 4 AutoML jobs (1w, 1m, 3m, 6m)
2. Budget: 1.5 hours each = $6-8 total
3. Evaluate against Boosted Tree baseline
4. If better: Use AutoML as ensemble component

**Status:** Already planned in V4 enhancement roadmap
**Timeline:** After Q4 2025 (holiday trading slow period)
