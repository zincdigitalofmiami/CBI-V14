✅ COMPLETED:
1. Consolidated features table with ALL signals
2. Signal interaction features (VIX-sentiment, tariff-VIX, etc.)
3. Market regime classification
4. Composite risk scoring

⏳ TRAINING (5-10 minutes):
1. zl_boosted_tree_signals_v5 - Main signal model
2. zl_boosted_tree_high_volatility_v5 - High volatility specialist
3. zl_boosted_tree_crisis_v5 - Crisis specialist

🎯 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- Base V3 MAE: 1.72
- With signals: Expected MAE ~1.2-1.4 (20-30% improvement)
- Better crisis detection and regime adaptation
- More robust predictions during volatile periods

📊 NEXT STEPS:
1. Wait for models to complete training
2. Evaluate performance:
   SELECT * FROM ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `cbi-v14.models.zl_boosted_tree_signals_v5`)
3. Compare to base model
4. Deploy best performer to production
