# Plans

All project plans organized by status.

## Structure

- **`active/`** - Current execution plans
  - Contains symlink to main plan (CBI_V14_COMPLETE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md)
- **`old/`** - Completed plans (by quarter)
- **`new/`** - Proposed plans pending approval

## Usage

1. New plans → Create in `new/`
2. Approved & active → Move to `active/`
3. Completed → Move to `old/YYYY-QX/`

## Main Plan

The main execution plan (CBI_V14_COMPLETE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md) stays in root for visibility.
A symlink exists in `active/` for organizational purposes.
